Question:
I am about to purchase a UT series wireless for use in Sioux Falls, and Eastern SD. There are two frequencies to choose from in stock, operating on 624.3 and 617.1MHz.


I have not been able to find a chart that crosses over your UT frequencies with the TV Stations in Sioux Falls SD.


Sioux Falls has the following TV stations:


17 KTTW FOX/UPN

23 KCSD-TV SDPTV

24 KCSD-DT SDPTV

26 KCPO-LP UPN

29 KSFY-DT ABC

32 KELO-DT CBS

36 KAUN

42 K42CC A1

44 KBNW-LP BLOOMBERG

46 KDLT NBC

47 KDLT-DT NBC

56 K56GF

66 K66.. TBN


In addition, I will want to use the UT wireless in Brookings SD where SDPTV has an application in for 18 KESD-DT.
