Question:
I have 8 combo units. I am using the antenna combiner unit but I have heard mix info on the proper set-up for groups. Should all the units be set to the same group? Please advise


Answer:

	All units should be set to the same group. Do not use groups A1 or A2. Instructions are provided in the User Guide at the following link:
