Title: Shure UT UHF WIRELESS hotter output level

Question:
I have the UT UHF receiver and have a question about the line/mic level switch on the back of the unit. Shouldn't the line input setting 'BOOST' the level like a preamp? I'm running into a situation where the level is just not high enough when I attach the output into my gear.


Answer:

	Yes. Set the UT4 volume control to 0. Set the mic/line switch to LINE. Slowly increase the volume control until you reach the desired signal level. The switch only effects the XLR connector.
