Question:
Will the PS1A work with a Neumann TLM-170 microphone? Does the PS1A output +4dB?


Answer:

	The PS1A is a phantom supply and provides 20 volts of phantom power. Most Neumann mics require 48 volts. Check the Neumann specifications.
	
	The PS1A is not a microphone preamp. The PS1A output level will equal the input level from the microphone. If the Neumann provides a +4dB output, so will the PS1A...but this is very unlikely.
