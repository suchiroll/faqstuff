Question:
For some odd reason your T series system for "The Headset" has a 1/4" connector which makes the transmitter practically useless for any other microphone but the Headset VHF microphone...My question is, is there an adapter that goes from TQG to 1/4" so that I may plug in my WCM16 head mic into my system? and if not how would you wire something like that?


Answer:

	The WCM16 requires +5 volts of dc bias to operate. This bias is not available on Shure transmitters that have a 1/4 female phone jack input. Your adapter cable idea will not work.
