Question:
I am buying a boundary microphone for a conference room (we had thought of a MX393/C) but the amplifier we will use has no phantom power.


Could you please suggest me what should I do best and could you give me a reference on how much should that solution amount?


What would be the price range for a phantom power supply or an MX1BP?


Would it be about the same to buy a MX391BP instead of an MX393+phantom power supply, in terms of functionality and in terms of cost?


In short which would be a good solution considering price?


Answer:

	If you do not have phantom power, the MX391BP/C would be a good choice. The only downside of the MX391BP is that it does not have a switch. Shures phantom power supply is model PS1A. Current prices can be found on the product pages of our web site.
