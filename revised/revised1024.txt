Question:
I have a 1987 vintage V15 Type V-MR cartridge. Can the VN5xMR stylus be used with that cartridge if I cannot find the VN5MR replacement?


Answer:

	Sorry, the VN5xMR stylus does not operate properly with the V15V-MR body. The stylus shank of the VN5xMR is too large to fit into the V15V-MR body.

	

	Conversely, the VN5MR stylus shank does not fit securely into the V15xMR body.
