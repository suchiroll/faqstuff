Question:
Does SHURE or any other company make an on-off switch that can be accessed by foot? I'm a drummer and it would be helpful if I could turn my voice microphone on and off by hitting a switch located on the floor with my foot.


Answer:

	Shure does not have such a product. There is one made by a company called ProCo Sound. Its called the Cough Drop. You can use it as a hand switch or a foot switch.
