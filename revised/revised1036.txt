Question:
A customer of mine asked me three questions regarding his SM82:


What was the retail cost?

Are they phantom powered?

What application are they used for?


Answer:

	The last U.S. suggested retail price of this microphone was $410.00 in 1989.
	
	The SM82 was powered by a 9.8 volt battery or by phantom power.
	
	This microphone was a rare type of microphone in that it had a line level output rather than the typical microphone level output. It was used for such things as TV remote broadcasts where having a mic preamp would be awkward.
