Question:
Could you please provide me some information about your microphones - I am looking for a conference (low profile table top preferred) or boundary mic. I would like one that doesn't require phantom power or batteries. The application is recording voice(s), people being interviewed. Thank you.


Answer:

	All of our current boundary microphone are condenser and thus require either phantom power or battery power. Our current boundary microphones are the MX390 series.
