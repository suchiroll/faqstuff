Title: Old 55S parts
Id: 1046
Legacy Id: 1079

Question:
I own a pair of 1971 55S microphones and I was wondering if replacement parts are available. Also, I cannot seem to find a serial number on either one. Are they marked somewhere other than the obvious? Can they be traced to original origin if so?

Answer:

	For parts availability, please contact our Service Department. Information concerning service, repair, parts and warranty of Shure products can be found at the following link:

	You might have luck with collectors of old mics. We suggest you start with: Tom Ellis - tomsmics@flexcomp.com
	
	Except for a few select early models, we do not use serial numbers on our microphones.
