Question:
I am in need of a wireless mic transmitter for a T3 Receiver. I would like to have a transmitter that would allow me to plug in any XLR type mic and convert it to a wireless mic transmitting on the frequency of the receiver that I have now.


Answer:

	We do offer the FP3 and the UR3 plug on transmitters. However, they will not work with theT3 receiver.
	
	The FP3 works with the FP5 or the SLX4 receiver.
	
	The UR3 works with any of the UR receivers.
