Question:
I own a very old JVC turntable, model SRC - 800, which has a Shure stylus, model M70B. I would like buy a stylus replacement from Shure, but I noticed model M70B is not listed among your current products. I did, however, notice a model M70BX listed among your stylus selections. Is M70BX the same as M70B? If not, which current Shure stylus is the equivalent replacement for M70B. Thanks in advance for your response.


Answer:

	The N70BX stylus will not fit in the M70B.
	
	The N70B replacement stylus is still available.
	
	The stylus can be ordered directly from the Shure Parts Department at 800-516-2525 or 847-600-8699.
