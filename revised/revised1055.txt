Question:
I have an old L4 Receiver. Which ones of the cordless microphones, which are currently in production, are compatible?


Answer:

	The LX series was the successor to the L series. Most of the frequencies used on the L series are available on the LX series, BUT not all. The following frequencies are NOT available on LX:
	
	177.000Mhz-Frequency K
	178.800Mhz-Frequency L
	181.000Mhz-Frequency R
	184.800Mhz-Frequency S
