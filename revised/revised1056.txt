Question:
Where can I find technical notes to tell me how phantom power works at design and component level?


Answer:

	Phantom power circuits are extremely simple. To see a schematic of a phantom power supply, click on the following link:
	
	Battery Powered Phantom Power Supply with Balanced Output
	
	Most mixers simply use a 48Vdc voltage source through two 6.8kohm 1% resistors.
