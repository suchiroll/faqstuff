Question:
I have a Prologue 16L-LC and I don't see any hint of it on your user guide pages here. It works fine but I would like the sheet on it and curious about age and MSRP. The other Prologues are totally different, this one's a cardioid condenser, black. You guys do a great job of keeping the old info in stock, perhaps this one slipped through the proverbial cracks?


Answer:

	The Prologue 16L-LC model number changed to the 16AM. The User Guide and price for the 16AM can be seen at:
