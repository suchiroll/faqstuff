Question:
I want to know the difference between MX185 and WL185. The model # is different but it seems these are same product.


Answer:

	The MX185 is the wired version. The WL185 is the wireless version. That is, the MX185 includes the preamp/impedance converter necessary to plug the microphone into a standard mixer. The WL185 does not include this preamp and will plug into any Shure bodypack.
