Question:
How compatible are the PSM 600 and the PSM 400. Specifically, can you use the P4R body pack receivers with the PSM 600 if they're set to the same channel?


Answer:

	No. The PSM400 receivers can not be used to pickup signals from the PSM 600 transmitter. They use two entirely different frequency ranges.
