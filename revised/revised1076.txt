Question:
Can I use a regular mixer instead of P4M Personal Monitor Mixer for In-ear Monitor system? I need more inputs. Is there any reason to use P4M mixer?


Answer:

	Another mixer can be used. But multiple P4M mixers can be used to provide more inputs. Check the P4M Mixer user guide for different configurations.
