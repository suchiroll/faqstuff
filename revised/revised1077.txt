Question:
I've owned all of the Type V15 cartridges. When I bought my original V15 Type V back in the early '80s, Shure made a series of styli for it, including standard spherical and elliptical versions, all with dynamic stabilizers. I am not looking for the Microridge (MR) or Hyperelliptical (HE) versions. For my reference, could you please give me the old part/model numbers for the original V15 Type V spherical and elliptical styli? What was the part number for the V15G replacement stylus with stabilizer and the suggested tracking force?

Will an N111E stylus fit into a V15V cartridge?

What is the best cartridge that Shure makes that can be obtained with a conventional biradial and/or conical stylus? (Not MR or HE)


Answer:

	The different models of the V15V consisted of:
	
	V15V: hyper-elliptical tip; dynamic stabilizer; premium packaging
	V15V-B: hyper-elliptical tip; dyanmic stabilizer; basic packaging
	V15G: spherical tip; dynamic stabilizer
	V15V-P: P-mount;hyper-elliptical tip; NO dynamic stabilizer
	V15V-MR: micro-ridge tip; dynamic stabilizer

	VN5G was the model number.
	
	Tracking force: 1 to 1.25 grams
	
	No, the N111E will not fit.
	
	The M97xE has a 0.2 x 0.7 elliptical stylus.
