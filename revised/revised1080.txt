Question:
Is there any difference between a L4-R/L1-R and a L4-CQ/L11-CQ? I notice that the transmitter on the L1-R is longer other than that I don't see any difference. Because of a frequency conflict I need to replace one with the other and want to make sure that there is no problem.


Answer:

	The L1 had some minor circuitry differences from the L11. The L series was replaced by the LX series.
