Question:
I have the older 'T4G Guitarist' wireless system. I'm having trouble finding a carry case for it, either a soft case or a hard case. I noticed that you still make a soft case (WA395A), but would the WA600 or the WA605 work with the T4G? If so, which one? If you could also include the price, I would really appreciate it. thanks, and keep up the great work. SHURE ROCKS!


Answer:

	The WA605 (17 wide) carrying case will work for the T4G receiver. And thanks for the compliment.
