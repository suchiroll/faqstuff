Question:
Do you have a portable power supply for my Shure wireless receiver?


Answer:

	Shure does not offer a battery supply.
	
	But one can be fabricated from Radio Shack parts. This concept works for Shure wireless receivers with a DC coax jack on the rear panel AND that use 12 volts DC for operation.
	
	Radio Shack has a battery holder that holds 8 AA batteries in series. This provides a 12 volt voltage source.
	
	The output terminal of the battery holder is a snap connector like used on a 9 volt battery. Purchase a mating snap connector and the proper DC coaxial connector to mate with the receiver power jack. The receiver should operate over 6 hours from the 8 AA batteries.
	
	Parts Needed (from Radio Shack):
	Battery holder for eight AA batteries - Part #270-407 or 270-387
	Battery terminal snap connector - Part #270-325 or 270-324
	DC Coaxial Plug - Part #274-1567
	Extra wire may be needed to extend the wires coming from the snap connector to DC coaxial plug.
