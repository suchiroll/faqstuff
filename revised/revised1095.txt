Question:
I have a Roland GR-30 guitar synth, and I was wondering if you make a wireless system that would work for this?


Answer:

	All of our systems can be purchased as a bodypack system. The bodypack system would have a 1/4 inch connecting cable that would connect the audio output of most synthesizers to the bodypack transmitter.
