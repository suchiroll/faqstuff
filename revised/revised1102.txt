Question:
My vintage RM950ED cartidge has very little sound on one track, and normal sound on the other. I changed the tonearm head with my spare Shure cartridge, and everything is normal, so I am pretty sure the problem is in the RM950ED.


Is the cartridge "dead", would a new stylus do any good, can it be repaired, is it worth messing with?


Answer:

	The cartridge is dead. The cartridge has been discontinued for some time and can not be repaired.
	
	Consider the ShureM92E as a replacement.
