Title: Vintage Mics replacement parts

Question:
I recently purchased a Shure 737A crystal microphone. The case was in very good shape. What I need is some help on replacing the crystal element. I realize you don't make this element anymore. I was hoping another crystal element could be substituted in its place. I also need the screws for the case. I believe they are the same screws that go in the 55SH II.

If you can't supply the element, do you have any idea where I might get an element that will work.

I would appreciate any help you could give me. Thank you for your time and consideration.
