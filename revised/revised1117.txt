Question:
I'm using a small mackie mixer non powered for my sound system. Does the PSM 400 need an additional power amp to power the ear monitor?


Answer:

	No, the PSM400 system does not need any power amp. With in-the-ear monitors, you are no longer using a loudspeaker, so a power amp is not needed.
