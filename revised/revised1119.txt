Title: SM81 SPL rating
Id: 1119
Legacy Id: 1155

Question:
I've been looking all over, and I can't seem to find a specific published SPL rating for the SM81. I'm using a pair of them now for drum overheads as well as stereo live recording. Although I've never had distortion problems, I'm wondering what that number is.


Answer:

	146dB SPL with 10 dB pad used.
