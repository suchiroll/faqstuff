Question:
Hello, I own many SM87 microphones. Recently, I discovered that I liked the Beta 87 grille (part no. RK312) better than the ones on my SM87s (RK214G). Are these interchangable?


Also, I discovered that there is a black grille (RK324G) for the Beta 87 Wireless microphone that is gorgeous. I was wondering if this would be compatible with my SM87 before I placed the parts order?


Answer:

	The answer is yes to both questions.
