Question:
This is my possible setup:

Audio mixer line out 1/4 phone, transformer high/low (set to low) with XLR out to U1 transmitter switchcraft TA-4F.


How exactly to wire XLR cable with Switchcraft TA4F?


It will be pin 1 to shield and pin 3 audio but which wire should I use out of XLR side? from pin 2 or 3???


Answer:

	XLR pin 1 (shield) to TA4F pin 1
	XLR pin 2 to TA4F pin 3
	XLR pin 3 to TA4F pin 1
	No connections to TA4F pin 4

	

	This cable can be purchased as Shure WA310.
