Question:
I am a proud owner of your V15 type Vmr cartridge. I've recently become very interested in the particulars of phono cartridges and I would like you to humour me and please tell me what the stylus rake angle of my cartridge is (assuming all other angles are set to your specifications).




Answer:

	The vertical tracking angle is 15 degrees, thus the V15 name.
