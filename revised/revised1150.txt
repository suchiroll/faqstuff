Question:
I have a V15 type II, brand new. I want to use it with my McIntosh MC 275 power amp and C22 preamp. Mac specs call for certain cartridge info and I can't find it on your spec sheet. I need to know:

1) input sensitivity, (in mV)

1) input impedence, (in ohms)




Answer:

	Nominal output voltage of the V15 II is 3.5 mV. Recommended load impedance for the V15 Type II is 47,000 ohms per channel.
