Question:
I purchased a Shure cartridge model M92E from Radio Shack about 2-months ago and have been having some audio trouble since. I seem to be getting a grounding hum through my speakers. I have connected the cartridge wiring according to the schematic provided in the documentation. I have checked the grounding of the system and it seems OK. I have an Onkyo CP-1100A turntable, which is about 7-yrs old and I have not had this problem with any of the other cartridges that I have installed. I would appreciate any guidance you could give me to correct this situation....I would appreciate a prompt reply.


Thanks you in advance for your assistance in this matter.



Answer:

	Since you have other cartridges that work fine and the M92E does not, we suspect a grounding problem inside of the M92E body. This cannot be repaired.
	
	We suggest you contact Shure Service for details on returning your M92E for inspection and possible replacement.
	
	Or you might ask Radio Shack to replace the M92E directly.
	
	Also, make certain there is ground wire connected from your turntable chassis to your preamp chassis. This is a critical ground connection for any turntable system.
