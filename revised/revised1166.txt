Title: SME tonearm parts
Id: 1166
Legacy Id: 1205

Question:
I lost the handsome silver-gray bias weight (the one with the thread through it) for my SME Series II tone arm. May I buy another one from you? (Not too expensive) Or would you tell me how much it weighed, and I'll make my own?! (Cheapo)


Answer:

	Shure stopped distributing SME tonearms in the mid to late 1980's. Shure no longer has parts for these tonearms. Try the following sources:SME Limited
