Question:
I am looking to buy an in ear monitor system to monitor at a monitor desk. And I was wondering if I buy the E1 or the E5 if I need the hard wire body packalso.

Answer:

	If the monitor mixing desk has a 3.5mm female jack headphone output with level control, then the E1 or E5 can connect directly.
	
	If the monitor desk does not have a headphone output, then use the P6HW in conjunction with the E1 or E5.
