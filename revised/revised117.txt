Question:
Is the velvet bag that comes with the KSM32 of any practical value?


Answer:

	The attractive velveteen pouch protects the microphone from dust either while its in storage or mounted on a stand. This allows the user to keep the microphone in place between tracking sessions without worry about dust contamination.
