Question:
I have a Technics SL-DD33 turntable outfitted with a Shure 800E cartridge. Questions:


--What kind of stylus is it? (diamond, sapphire, etc.)

--How long will it last?

--If I need to replace it, what should I replace? (the entire cartridge, stylus only?) I'm looking for maximum fidelity and longevity.


What's the catalogue number(s) for the replacement stylus?


Answer:

	The stylus is diamond. The life is typically 500 to 750 playing hours. Only the stylus needs to be replaced to bring the unit back to like new condition.
	
	Use the N92E replacement stylus.
