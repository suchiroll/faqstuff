Question:
I was reading the info on the SM7B microphone and I was wondering if it requires phantom power? I will be using this microphone with several other microphones that do require phantom power. I just want to make sure that I will not have any problems if I use this microphone. Thanks in advance for your help.



Answer:

	The SM7B does not require phantom power and is not affected if phantom power is present on its mixer input.
