Question:
Do you make a LPF version of the "A15HP" HPF? I remember using one back in the late 1980's and I'm now searching for about 16 of these XLR in-line barrel devices to eliminate RF from a nearby AM broadcast station, so an upper cut-off frequency of about 18kHz would be excellent.


Answer:

	The A15LP was discontinuedseveral years ago. We no longer have a product that serves that function.
