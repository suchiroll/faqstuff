Question:
I just bought a pair of SM81 mics and wonder what type of preamp is needed for them to work properly. Will an ART Tube MP suffice?


Answer:

	Any microphone preamp that supplies phantom power will work. Make certain to turn on the phantom power for the preamp; that you are using. Contact ART to find out if this preamp has phantom power.
