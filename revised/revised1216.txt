Question:
About 7-8 years ago I purchased a Shure Green Bullet Microphone for use playing my harmonicas. That version does not have a volume control on the mic. Can one be added or is my only option buying a new mic with the control. I love the sound I get with my current mic and hate to give it up. Thanks.


Answer:

	Adding on/off Switch and Potentiometer to 520D - Green Bullet Microphone

	Many harmonica players wish to control the output volume of the 520D Green Bullet microphone. Additionally, an on/off switch may be added.

	When adding an on/off switch and potentiometer to the 520D Green Bullet microphone follow these procedures using the included drawing (high impedance output).

	
		Red will remain the same.
	
		Connect both the switch and the potentiometer across the blue and black wires inside the microphone housing.
	
		The switch should be connected closest to the microphone element, and the potentiometer should be connected after the switch in the circuit (nearer the plug).
	
		Connections at the plug should remain the same.


	Note: If the potentiometer is placed before the switch in the circuit, the switch will not work.

	Note: For low impedance applications substitute a five (5) kilohm potentiometer for the 100 kilohm potentiometer.
