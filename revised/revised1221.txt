Question:
I am coming to over to the US to work with an FP33. I will be bringing my own external powering but am in need of specifications of the type of jack plug required.


Answer:

	The FP33 requires a DC coaxial power female (jack) with the inner diameter being 2.5mm. Outer diameter of 5.5 mm.

	

	An example is part number SC1051-ND available from www.digikey.com. The FP33 DC input is non-polarized and will handle 12 to 30 volts of DC.
