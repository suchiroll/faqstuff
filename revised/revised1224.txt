Question:
I use and have used your SC35C cartridge/needle for DJ'ing for about 12 years. I am interested in trying out the M35S and M35X needles. My question is do I need a different cartridge to fit the M35S and M35X needles or can these needles be used with the cartridge I currently have on my turntables that accomodates the SC35C needles?



Answer:

	Yes, the N35S stylus and N35X stylus will fit in the SC35 body.
