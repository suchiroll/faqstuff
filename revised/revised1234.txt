	1. In what city and country is your school located?
	2. Please confirm that you require up to 12 wireless systems operating simultaneously.
	
	Selling prices are set by your local Shure dealers, not Shure Inc. We can only supply you with suggested retail prices.
	
	At 06/18/2001 03:48 PM we wrote - The only high band VHF TV frequencies open in your area are channels 10 and 12. In the Shure T Series, there are only two systems available in these channels. In the LX series, there are seven systems available. So consider the purchase of seven LX systems: 4 in TV channel 10; 3 in TV channel 12.
	
	For the remaining three system, consider the Shure UT UHF system or the Shure UC system. For help in ordering the exact systems for your area, call the Shure rep for New Jersey: Peter Schmitt Company at 973-785-3337. Ask for Bart.
