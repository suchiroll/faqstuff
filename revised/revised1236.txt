Question:
What is the current average price for a LX1 Body Pack Transmitter, we are looking to by at least 16 (4 sets of 4)..and also the price for a WL93 Series Subminiature Condenser Lavalier Microphone


Also a compatibility question, we currently use VEGA VHF Packs..and were wondering if the mics were compatible with those packs. Thanks for all your help.

Answer:

	Shures U.S. retail price list can be found at the following link:
	
	
	
	The wiring of the Vega VHF transmitter is not the same as the Shure transmitter. Though the audio connectors are the same, a mic wired for Vega will not work when connected to a Shure LX transmitter.
