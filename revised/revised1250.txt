Question:
I have a Shure ME95ED cartridge  a Shure ME97HE cartridge, but I don't know they are moving magnet or moving coil. Which one is a hi model? Which year are they made in? How about they compare to the Shure V15VXMR cartridge?


Answer:

	All Shure cartridges are moving magnets. We have never offered a moving coil. The ME97HE is the better model. Both are inferior to the V15VxMR. Your models were made in the 1990s.
	
	Will you hear a difference if you upgrade? It depends on the quality of your entire audio system
