Question:
I just started doing live performances on the keyboards, and I am looking for a professional quality microphone that will work good for me. I've used microphones before, but they always seem to make me sound either "muddy" or "tinny." What is it that I need to be looking for in a quality microphone? If you could either mail me back and let me know, or possibly refer me to a web page so I can do some researching, I would be very appreciative! Thank you so much for your time and effort.


Answer:

	To see which microphones we recommend for vocal use, please see our online Selection Guides at the following link: Which microphone should I use on ... ? (Selection Guides)
	
	We suggest that you visit a local Shure dealer to try the different microphones. It would be useful to record the microphones so that you can listen back to you voice on these microphones. In the end, only you can decide which microphone sounds best for your voice.
