Question:
We have SM58 microphones and we need cables for them. Can you please let me know which cable to order and the price of the cable.


Answer:

	That depends on what connector you need on the other end of the cable and how long you need the cable to be.
	
	Our most popular XLR to XLR cable is the C25J.
