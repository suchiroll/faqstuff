Question:
I just bought an used FP31 Mixer and could not find any information on your web site. Well, I guess it's been discontinued for quite a while. Could you please send me an user guide on that product?


Answer:

	The user guide for the FP31 is in the discontinued products area of the Shure web site at:http://pubs.shure.com/guide/Model-FP31/en-US.pdf
