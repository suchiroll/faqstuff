Question:
I have a Sony PS-LX529 Turntable that came with a Shure M111HE Cartridge. In looking through your site, there is not a direct replacement cartridge or stylus identified. Do you have other replacements that I could use, either cartridge or stylus? The original Sony operating instructions list a VL-45G replacement cartridge or a ND-145G replacement stylus. I assume these to be Sony part numbers, but might be used for a cross reference. Any help is appreciated.


Answer:

	If your question is which replacement stylus fits my cartridge, then please see our online stylus cross reference.
