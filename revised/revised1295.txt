Question:
Our church bought the following product (I believe in South Africa - some time ago):

Shure T4V Diversity Receiver and the T1 Transmitter.

This wireless system has constantly given us problems with feedback. I have recently replaced the mixing desk and all speakers in the church and was hoping that this would solve the problem. I have speakers on the main stage, which I believe are interfering with the transmitter.

Do you have any information or recommendations to stop this feedback? Is this model mic to sensitive to be used for preaching?

Your response will be greatly appreciated.


Answer:

	Acoustic feedback is a system wide problem; it is not related only to the microphone. Please read the following links to better understand the root causes of feedback and possible solutions:
	
	Basics of Equalization and Feedback
	
	Themicrophone may or may not be the guilty party. Understanding of the complete feedback path is essential to solving your problem. Also, search our online FAQ for the word feedback.
