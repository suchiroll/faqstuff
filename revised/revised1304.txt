Question:
I bought a Shure microphone SM11 model, and I have a doubt. How does change it characteristics (frequency response, directivity, etc) with changes in the temperature? I hope to use that in a place where the temperature change between -10° Celsius and 30° Celsius


Answer:

	We do not have precise specifications for what you are asking. However, the changes should be minimal.
