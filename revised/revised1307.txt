Question:
How do I connect a professional microphone to a Guillemot Maxi Studio ISIS soundcard?


Answer:

	You might have to build a custom cable for this sound card. This sound card does not have a standard input configuration. The pin configuration for the Maxi Studio ISIS is:
	
	Tip: +5V
	Ring: Audio
	Sleeve: Ground
	
	The A96F should still work with this sound card, but we cannot comment on the other products mentioned in the following link.
