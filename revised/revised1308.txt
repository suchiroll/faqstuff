Question:
My group uses several U1 body-packs. Most are fitted with the solid-style antenna (you can't bend it). We just bought two more which came with a very flexible antenna (you could tie it in a knot).


Are there any performance differences between the two antenna styles?


Answer:

	There will be negligible performance differences.
