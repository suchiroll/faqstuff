Question:
I have been told by others that someone blowing into a mike to test volume, etc. will damage it. Is this true?


Answer:

	In most cases, blowing a stream of air into a microphone will not damage the microphone, but in the rare case, might damage the loudspeaker. We suggest saying Test 1,2,3 as a safer alternative.
	
	However, never test a ribbon microphone by blowing into it as the stream of air might stretch or rip the fragile ribbon. Ribbon microphones are now quite rare and mostly found in recording studios.
