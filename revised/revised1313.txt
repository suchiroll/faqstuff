Question:
I have a 1946 Philco record player with a Shure crystal cartridge which I am sure is no longer available. Could you suggest a replacement cartridge? This tone arm uses a 1/2 inch two screw mount. Any help would be appreciated.


Answer:

	Crystal cartridges are no longer manufactured to our knowledge. The Shure M78S 78 rpm cartridge is a 1/2 mount product and is still sold.
	
	But it will require the use of a preamp to increase its signal level to equal a crystal cartridge.
