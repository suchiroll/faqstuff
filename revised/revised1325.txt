Question:
We need to replace the microphone used as the voice input channel for a Honeywell recorder. The old microphone is a Shure DY88Y. We do not have any specs on this mic. What do you have that replaces that model?


Answer:

	The DY88Y was similar to the Shure 575S. The 575 model is discontinued. A Shure VP64 will have similar specifications to the 575.
