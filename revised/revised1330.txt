Title: How do I setup the frequency on multiple UC systems?

Question:
What group and channel settings should I use when I use more than 10 UC series wireless systems simaltaneously? Right now I have 10 systems, so I use groups 0-9. I plan on purchasing 3 more complete systems shortly, and want to make sure I can use them. Will this still work?


Answer:

	All of your systems should be in the same group. Then place each one in a different channel within that group. There are 16 channels in every group, so you can use up to 16 units simultanously in the same frequency band. Now, we also offer two different frequency bands (UA and UB). You can operate 16 UA systems and 16 UB systems at the same time for a total of 32 simultaneous frequencies.
	
	So, for example, if you have multiple systems, you would put them as such:
	
	Group / Channel
	3 / 1
	3 / 2
	3 / 3
	3 / 4
	3 / 5
	3 / 6
	3 / 7
	3 / 8
