Question:
Archive info requested. Just looking for basic info on the vintage mic T-17-B(ie. year of mfg., cost, specs, tech data, etc.). Anything you might be able to provide would be helpful  appreicated.


Answer:

	Little information exists. The model T-17 was built for the the U.S. military during World War II. It was not sold as part of the Shure standard line of products.
	
	We have an example of the T-17 in our product archives, but it does not have a specifications sheet.
	
	A page for the 1946 Shure catalog says only this: The T-17 Hand Held Microphone is the standard and most widely used microphone in World War II. Used in planes, tanks, and for practically all other hand-held requirements.
	
	No records remain at Shure regarding the T-17. All records were likely given to the government for the miltary archives.
