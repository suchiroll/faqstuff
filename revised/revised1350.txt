Question:
How much does lightning and other weather phenomenon effect RF reception?


Answer:

	Lightning typically affects AM transmission more than FM transmission. Wireless mics use FM transmission. However, as lightning is a very powerful event, it is possible that it could create problems for wireless mics.
	
	To our knowledge, your question has never been researched for wireless mics. You may find more information on weather related interference from The American Radio Relay League: http://www.arrl.org
