Question:
I'm looking for a wired headset mic that sounds like the SM58. This would be a drummers dream.What do you have? Why are they not out there?

Answer:

	None of the current Shure headworn mics equal the SM58 response. The sound of a mic is due to many things, including the type of element, the acoustical design, the size of the diaphragm, etc.
	
	It would violate the laws of physics to shrink down all the elements that make up the SM58 (and its sound) into a product small enough to wear on ones head.
