Title: Tone Oscillator on M267

Question:
The tone oscillator on my M267 does not work correctly...sounds like a dying Canyon Wren. When I switch on the front panel control, the tone comes on, then the frequency drops, and the tone goes away entirely...a nice effect, but not what I'm looking for in a tone oscillator. How can I repair this?


Answer:

	Try replacing C223, 1uF at 25Vdc.
