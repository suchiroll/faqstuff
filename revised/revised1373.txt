Question:
I'm a student under taking a course in sound engineering and I'm research (for school) the Shure SM7 microphone. I was hoping if you have time, can you please let me know of any links or personal experienced information that will help me with this project, example frequency response graphs, features and specifications. Thank you for your time.
