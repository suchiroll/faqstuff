Question:
I HAVE A CHOIR AREA WHICH IS ABOUT 25 FEET WIDE WITH 4 ROWS BACK. ON EACH END OF THE FRONTAL SECTION IS A SWEPT WING OF ABOUT 35 DEGREES, EACH HAVING 4 ROWS. (NOT QUIET A U-SHAPE). THE FRONTAL AREA HAS A SOLID BANISTER OR WALL WHICH IS ABOUT 40 INCHES HIGH. THE CEILINGS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH, AND IN ORDER TO USE OVERHEAD MICROPHONES, THE CHURCH WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEWS REMOVED TO ALLOW A MOTORIZED LIFT DEVICE INSIDE. COST WISE, THIS IS PROHIBITIVE.

MY QUESTION IS WOULD A BOUNDARY MIC. WORK FROM THE FLOOR, OR ALTERNATIVELY, IS THERE ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING THE CHOIR IN THE SOUND SYSTEM? THE COST SHOULD BE CONSERVATIVE DUE TO BUDGET RESTRAINTS.


Answer:

	A boundary mic would be much closer to the front choir row than the rear, so the blend may not be optimal. If you want to try a boundary mic, consider the MX393/C.
	
	Appearance aside, we recommend the following: twoSM81 mics, mounted on a A27M stereo swivel adapter, held up in the air 10 to 12 feet by a S15A mic stand.
