Title: Transformer for PE588

Question:
I am trying to rebuild an old PE588 handheld mic. Unfortunately, someone tried to remove the on/off switch and the took the small transformer with it. Do you know what the specs are for that transformer?


Answer:

	The PE588 has been discontinued for over 30 years. Our best guess is a mic level transformer with a primary of 100 ohms and a secondary of 15,000 ohms.
