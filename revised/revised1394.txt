Title: SM98A Preamp - replacement for ILP-1
Id: 1394
Legacy Id: 1446

Question:
I was told that the adaptor ILP-1 is no longer available and that a RK183PK would work in its place. Is this true?


Also, I am looking for an adaptor that if my wireless system goes down I can still use my SM98A, WL184, WA302 and or WH20TQG by just plugging into a line adaptor and going on with the program.


I am using a UC4 with a UC1 and the above mics. Will the ILP-1 work and is it in stock or is there a better way?

What is the wiring to make a cable for the WH20TQG to a XLR hookup? I need to make a pig tail type.




Answer:

	The ILP-1 is discontinued and no longer available.
	
	1. For the SM98A, the RPM626 preamp works best. It requires phantom power from the mixer to operate. The RK183PK will work, but not as well as the RPM626.
	
	2. For the WL184, the RK183PK preamp works best. It requires phantom power from the mixer to operate.
	
	3. For the WH20TQG, a preamp is not required. A custom cable must be fabricated with a four pin male Tini QG connector on one end, and a three pin male XLR connector on the other end. Shure does not sell a cable like this. Contact us for the wiring if you decide to fabricate this cable yourself.
