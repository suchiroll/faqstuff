Question:
I am looking for a mic that is normally on and has a press and hold switch to turn it off. This is the opposite of the Press to Talk button. The regular On/Off switch is not acceptable. The application is for an attorney table where they would hold the mic switch in order to have a private conversation.


Answer:

	Look at the Microflex series of products for models with this feature.
