Question:
I have a Shure tonearm, cartridge and stylus Model SME 3009. Can you provide any information on weighting and adjustment for this arm?


Answer:

	Shure did not make the SME tonearm. It was made by SME in England and distributed by Shure until the mid-1980s. We no longer have a business relationship with SME.
