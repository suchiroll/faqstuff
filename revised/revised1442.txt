Question:
Greetings,


I have been given this email address to get some Shure product information.


I have two sets of questions:



#1

I have the Shure T1 transmitter and a VP3-CV receiver. Right now, I am using a single antenna receiver, and I am thinking of going to a diversity receiver. Can you tell me which receivers would work with the T1 tranmitter, to upgrade from the VP3-CV receiver? Are there choices, and what would the prices be?


#2

Is there an outfit, that would include a new transmitter and a new diversity receiver combined? If I upgrade from the Shure T1 and VP3-CV, what would your suggestions be. I am primarily micing a dancer who moves around a lot, who speaks but doesn't sing. I recently purchased a WL185 mic and a WCM16 headset, so what ever I purchase I would want these items to be compatible with them.


Thank you so much for your help.


Answer:

	You can use the T4N-CV, or the LX4-CV. Prices are found at:

	
	
	
	#2 Consider the LX14 system. It does not include a microphone. You can use the WL185 or WCM16 with the LX14 system.
