Question:
Hi, I am looking for a the smallest and least visable headset made. We currently have a LX system with lapel and our church pastor doesn't want to come off like a rock star. Our room is quite live so we tend to get feedback if we don't dial out mid range frequencies with the lapel. What is your ecommendation?

Answer:

	Check out the Shure Beta53, MX153,and the Countryman headworn mics, prewired for Shure transmitters and distributed by Shure, such as the WCE6.
