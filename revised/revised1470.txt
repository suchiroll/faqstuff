Question:
I've searched in your FAQ for about 20 minutes and couldn't find any articles about this particular product.

I have a Shure Premier Cartridge (no other product #'s etc...bought in the mid 80's) that I need a replacement stylus for.

Could you please direct me to a location where I can purchase a replacement stylus & what the part number of the stylus is?

Answer:

	As you cannot find a model number, please send the cartridge and stylus to Shure Service. We might be able to suggest an available stylus once we have the cartridge in hand. If there is a stylus available, you may purchase it directly from Shure Service.
