Question:
I have an old Soundesign stereo system. I've been downloading my LP's into my computer. Some of the LP's seem to have a lot of static and I've been looking for a needle that might help get rid of the static if possible. I can't even find a needle anywhere. Thank you. I hope that you sell something that might help me.


Answer:

	1. If the noise is indeed caused by static electricity, the Shure M97xE or Shure V15VxMR will help. Both have dynamic stabilizers that contain a carbon fiber brush the reduces static.
	
	2. If the noise is caused by dirt, use a LP disc washing system.
	
	3. If the noise is caused by vinyl damage, there are digital editing systems that reduce clicks and pops. An English company called CEDAR is a leader in this field.
