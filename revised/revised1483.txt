Question:
I found an old Shure 315 microphone and i would love to be able to get the cable for it or the connector that goes on the end so that i can put it back into use. Can you help me find one? Thanks in advance for your help.


Answer:

	The model 315 requires an Amphenol MC3M on the cable. We do not carry these connectors.You can get pre-wired cables from Tom Ellis (214-328-3225).
