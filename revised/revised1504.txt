Question:
What is the difference between the SM58 and the BG3.1 mics?


Answer:

	Though these mics have similar specifications, the SM58 definitely sounds better: more low end and an extended high end.
	
	If you intend to use the mic only for speech, you will likely hear little difference between these two models. But in a music application, the SM58 will be better.
