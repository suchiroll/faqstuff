Question:
I have a wireless system Shure model #UC14/98 my question today is can I use two body packs with the same receiver? I purchased the unit to use with my tenor sax but lately I have been asked to do some alto sax parts so I'm having to use a wired mic for my alto. I'm hoping that by programming another transmitter/body pack for my alto, I can please let me know if its possible. I really can't afford to purchase another right now. Also, do you sell another style of bell clamp? The present one that comes with the UC14/98 is really a pain in the behind. I'm thinking more like a clip on type. Something I can squeeze with two fingers and clip on the sax bell.


Answer:

	Can I use two body packs with the same receiver? * Yes, but only one transmitter can be powered up. If both transmitters are on at the same time, they will interfer with each other.
	
	Also do you sell another style of bell clamp? * Look at the Beta98H/C.
