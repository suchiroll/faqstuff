Question:
I have an old 565 microphone and really like it. It is the model that

screws on the top of the stand rather than going into a clip. A friend

bought an SM58 and it just plain old doesn't sound anywhere as good. What

model is there that is comparable in sound to my old mic.

The old microphone is model 565S Unisphere I Dynamic and the new is an

SM58. Is the old microphone high impedance only or is it dual impedance? I

hope This is what you needed.




Answer:

	Please verify the exact model numbers of each mic. (Shure does not make a "SM585".) Also, tell us to what device you are connecting the mics. With this information, we might be able to help.
	
	At 08/23/2001 12:49 PM we wrote - The 565S and the SM58 are nearly identical. They should sound very similar if both are working properly.
	
	The 565S was dual impedance. The SM58 is only low impedance. If the 565S is set to high impedance, the SM58 will require a Shure A95UF transformer to equal the sound of the 565S.
	
	If the 565S is set to low impedance and the SM58 does not sound similar, there could be a problem with the SM58.
