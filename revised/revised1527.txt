Question:
Can I use a N78S replacement in my V15 type V-MR cartridge?


Answer:

	Unfortunately, the N78S will not fit. The N78S stylus shank cover is too fat and will not fit into the stylus opening on the V15V-MR or the V15V stylus opening. The stylus also does not fit earlier V15 models: type IV, type III, type II, or type I.
	
	The N78S DOES fit the V15VxMR.
