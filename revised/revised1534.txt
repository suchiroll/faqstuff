Question:
I'm a court reporter and some courtrooms have terrible sound systems. I want to record the sound and ensure the quality. Basically I want the sound amplified. I currently have two Sound Grabbers from Martel Electronics for a tape recorder. If you have any suggestions, please contact me. Thank you for your time.
