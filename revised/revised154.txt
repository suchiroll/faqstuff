Question:
Which frequencies did the T, LX, SC, and EC series use in the U.S.?


Answer:

	That depends on the wireless series. The tables below shows what frequencies were used on our different VHF systems in the United States. International versions may vary. Note that you cannot use all available frequencies at the same time. All of these systems are now discontinued.
