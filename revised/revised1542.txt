Question:
I just purchased a Shure wireless microphone yesterday to free myself of the wire. However, the performance is unsatisfactory comparing to the Beta 58 wired microphone that I have. Can I unscrew the microphone of the Beta 58 and put it on the wireless transmitter? and would it make a difference?


Answer:

	Unfortunately, a wired Beta 58 cartridge will not fit or work on a wireless handheld transmitter. Many Shure wireless systems have removeable cartridges on the handheld. If yours does, you would need to get a wireless Beta 58 cartridge, model #RPW118. The RPW118 will screw right onto the handheld transmitter and work with the handheld transmitter.
	
	Would it make a difference? * Depends on the quality of the rest of the system and your expectations.
