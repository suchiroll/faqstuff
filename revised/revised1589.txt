Question:
What is the maximum cable length I can use with the 514B mic while still providing clear audio and PTT functionality? What is the best type of cable to use in this application?


Answer:

	We will assume that the 514B will be feeding a device with a low impedance, balanced input. In that case, 1,000 feet of cable is acceptable.
	
	Use a microphone cable with a shielded twisted pair for the audio, and an unshielded twisted pair for the PTT circuit. Check: http://www.belden.com
