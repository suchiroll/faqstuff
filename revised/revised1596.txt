Question:
I just bought an M44-7 and whenever I play a certain record it would leave white particles where ever the needle was just on is there any thing wrong with my needles or is it just my tonearm height and tonearm weight??


Tonearm Height: 4

Tonearm Weight: 3



Answer:

	We have never heard of this problem. There may be a problem with the vinyl used to make that "certain record".
