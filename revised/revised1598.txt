Question:
I'm looking into a wireless mic system (2 lapels  a handheld) for doing weddings. I am not sure what I will exactly be needing and would like some suggestions. I am looking for a system that is moderately priced yet sufficient for my needs. The camera that I will be purchasing is a Canon XL1. I hope that you can give me some feed back.
