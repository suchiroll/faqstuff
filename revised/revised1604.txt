Question:
OK, I understand the M78S is really a stereo cartridge, but how do you wire it for mono playback. My turntable has the standard stereo 4 wires (L, LG, R, RG). For now, I just have one channel wired and have the amp set up to play 2 channel mono.


Which channel plays the vertical in the groove and which channel is horizontal (for mono 78's). I'm looking for the least groove noise.


Answer:

	Some 78 RPM records were modulated in the vertical plane; some in the horizontal plane. The M78S is very compliant in both planes and will play either type of record well.
	
	There is no "correct " answer to your question. Which wiring scheme works best may be different from record to record. Try this order: 1) Left and Right channels in parallel; 2) Left channel only; 3) Right channel only. Use whichever provides the best sounding result.
	
	The M78S works well for 78 RPM records for one main reason: the large radius of the diamond tip. The groove width of 78 RPM records require the stylus tip with a minimum radius of 2.0 mils. The M78S is 2.5 mils.
