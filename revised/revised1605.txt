Id: 1605

Question:
I am going to install some home automation which will be controlled via voice recogination hopefully via some good microphones mounted in key rooms, I have heard that some users are using the SM11 mic. Can you recommend the correct microphone for this type of application. The smaller the better.


Answer:

	We suggest the MX180 series or MX300 series. These mics require phantom power from the mic mixer or the mic preamplifier.
	
	What is Phantom Power?
