Question:
I am wondering if you have done any tests with the FP23 and lithium AA batteries? Will it work and will it give longer recording times?



Answer:

	Without phantom power activated, the current draw of the FP23 is approximately 50 milliamps. The milliamp/hours rating of a typical alkaline AA battery is 1,200. 1,200 divided by 50 equals 24 hours of FP23 operating time.
	
	If a lithium battery provides more than 1,200 milliamp/hours, it will power the FP23 for a longer time than an alkaline AA battery.
