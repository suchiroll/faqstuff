Question:
Can I use bicolor LED in the MX392 or MX393?  I want it to be red when the microphone is off and green when the microphone is on.

Answer:

	No, the preamp and electronics inside the microphone do not support a bi-color LED.
	
	If you are using the MX392, you could design your own electronics to run an external bi-color LED off the Logic wires.
