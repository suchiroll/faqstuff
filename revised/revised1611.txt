Question:
I was told that Shure makes a mic that is worn like the WH20, but instead of the mic mounted on the side of the head, it actually comes over the top of the head.

From my understanding, the mic itself actually comes over the top of the head and down in front of the face. I visualize a tiny boom mic "half moon" shaped???



Answer:

	The SM10A band goes over the top of the head. The mic itself is mounted at the side of the head. The boom arm is rigid but is adjustable via a thumbscrew.
