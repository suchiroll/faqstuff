Question:
I just purchased two M35X cartridges and I am experiencing a lot of difficulty removing the stylus from one of the cartridges. I have followed the steps outlined in the instruction manual and I was able to remove the first stylus from the cartridge without any problem. However, the second stylus seems to be wedged and is causing me alot of difficulty in removing it from its cartridge. I am also worried that this will damage the cantilever and/or the magnet.


Answer:

	The stylus should remove smoothly. We suggest you return the problem M35X cartridge/stylus to Shure Service for repair or replacement. Please contact our Service Department at 800-516-2525.
