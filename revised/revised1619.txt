Question:
I am trying to connect a Shure SCM268 to a Panasonic AG-456 video camera. I am using the XLR output at line level on the mixer to a stereo mini plug on the video camera. I am getting a buzz and picking up a ticking from the motor in the video camera when it is recording. What is the best way to connect the mixer to the video camera? Are they compatible?


Answer:

	Try a cable wired as follows: Connecting the M367 to my stereo camcorder
	
	Also consider an XLR adapter box from Beachtek or JuicedLink
