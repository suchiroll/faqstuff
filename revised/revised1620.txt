Question:
I have a T2 wireless transmitter with SM58 mic head. I'm quite unhappy with the proximity effect, and I'm planning on purchasing another mic head. I read that the Beta 87A virtually has no proximity effect, is this true? Can I buy a Beta 87A cartridge, and screw it on to my T2? I read that it is a condenser mic, in need of phantom power. Can the my T2 handle this cartridge?

Answer:

	The Beta 87A also has proximity effect. Any unidirectional microphone has proximity effect. Omnidirectional microphones do not have proximity effect.
	
	If you still wish to try it, the Beta 87A wireless cartridge (model RPW120) will work on the T2 transmitter.
