Question:
I inherited a Marantz TT151 turntable. The tonearm has a Shure M99 cartridge. Unfortunately, the top of the cartridge looks like it was scratched, so I can't quite make out the final identifying letter. I think it's an "E", but I can't be sure.


On the body of the turntable are the words "Replacement Stylus CTS551." Would this possibly help determine what cartridge I have? If so, could you also recommend a replacement stylus or cartridge?


Answer:

	The M99E was indeed a Shure cartridge model. The replacement stylus is the N104E.
