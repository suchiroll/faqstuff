Question:
I recently bought a Sennheiser EW 135 wireless. When I turned off the hand held transmitter first it almost blew out my speakers. I brought it back. I am told that your LX4 system has a feature to keep this from happening by instantly muting the signal in this event is this true? If so you should tout this fact in your advertiseing.


Answer:

	The amount of pop experienced by the LX system is dependent on the squelch control setting. The LX system uses a noise sensitive squelch.The type of squelch that you are thinking of is called Tone Key.See the following booklet for a description of squelch circuits:Selection and Operation: Wireless Microphone Systems
