Question:
I'm a production guy at a local radio station and have recently purchased an MD Recorder to use to record sfx and atmosphere/ambience for my creative work. I read MIX magazine on a fairly regular basis, and some of the field recording articles I've read mention using a stereo pair for such ventures. My question is: A pair of what type of mic?


Answer:

	What we recommend is a condenser microphone that has a flat frequency response, like the Shure SM81 or KSM141.
