Question:
You sell a microphone through Radio Shack, part no 3301070 (pro-omni, dyanamic) and I would like to know the equivalent Shure model and part number.


Answer:

	There is no direct equivalent. The closest Shure model is the Shure VP64A, and it is more expensive than the Radio Shack model.
