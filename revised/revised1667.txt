Question:
Please advise the diameter of G12CN gooseneck. Please advise the maximum weight of microphone which the gooseneck can support. Can it support the SM57 microphone?


Answer:

	The diameter is approximately 1/2". The maximum weight depends upon the angle of the gooseneck. Due to leverage, the gooseneck will support less weight as its position becomes more horizontal.
	
	In general, the SM57 can be supported by a 1/2" gooseneck with a 12" length.
