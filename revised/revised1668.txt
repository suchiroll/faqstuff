Question:
I currently own a Shure SM 57 mic and a Shure BG 4.0 mic that I use for recording celtic harp music. I am in need of a pre-amp. Please advise me on a clean pre-amp (not too costly). I am very satisfied with the Shure mics and I think I should go with a Shure pre-amp.

I use a Shure SM57 and Shure BG 4.0 to record harp music. I need a clean pre-amp for these two microphones. The output of the pre-amp should have balanced and unbalanced capabilities. I will be going from the pre-amp to a hi-fidelity analog recorder by either XLR connections (preferably) or RCA connectors. The inputs on the pre-amp should be XLR. Also, the pre-amp should be reasonably priced.
