Question:
System purchased in 97 or 98. Frequency: V (169.445) MHz. Used for aerobics instruction. Not used in more than a year. Has static seeming to originate from either mic or transmitter, gets worse when I manipulate the antenna and/or cord that connects mic to transmitter.


Best guess?


Thanks very much.
