Question:
I have the RXP3 cartridge. I would like to know the details on this cartridge: its stylus shape and dimensions, and if available, more construction details.


I am using a tracking force of 1.3 grams. Can you confirm that this is an acceptable setting?


Answer:

	The RXP3 stylus is the same as the N104E. The N104E is elliptical with a radius of 0.2 x 0.7 mils. It is most similar to the current M94E (1/2 mount) or MP94E (P-mount).
	
	The recommended tracking force for the RXP3 is 0.75 to 1.5 grams.
