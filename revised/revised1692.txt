Question:
A friend bought our church some Shure microphone C-Series 8900. I was just wondering if you could provide some practical advice on this mic.



Answer:

	The C Series is an entry level product. It is designed primarily for home use: recording, karaoke, etc. In short, it is a mic for a beginner or casual user. Though the low price is attractive, it would not have been our first choice for a church application. However, it may still work quite well for you.
