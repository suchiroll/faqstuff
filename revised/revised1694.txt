Question:
I have a large UHF handheld wireless microphone. It is not a Shure but is similiar in size to your largest mic. A friend of mine had a Shure clip that fit it nicely. Which of your clips are the largest? A25D or A57F or another?


Answer:

	The clip you are seeking is WA371. The A25D or A57F will not fit your transmitter.
