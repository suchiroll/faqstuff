Question:
I'm currently singing in a Big Band as a soloist (soprano). I want to buy my own microphone. The microphone must "kill the highest tones" and bring out the wide range of tones in my voice. So that overall the warmth of my voice will be heard. I have tested the SM58 as well as the Beta 58A. Can you advice me? Or maybe come up with other suggestions?


Answer:

	Which mic did you like? Both are excellent mics. Your choice must be based on what each mic does for your voice. That we cannot predict via email as we have never heard you sing through the SM58 or Beta 58.
	
	A singer choosing a mic for a singer is like a guitarist choosing an instrument. It makes no difference what other people think; it is what the musician hears.
	
	We do suggest you also try the Shure Beta 87. It will sound quite different than either 58 model.
