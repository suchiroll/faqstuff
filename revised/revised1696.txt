Question:
I am trying to find a new windscreen for an SM7. I saw on your website that you seem to have a windscreen for the SM7B that might fit. I wondered if you would know if that is the case, and if not, if it is possible to secure a windscreen for the SM7.


Answer:

	The windscreen for the SM7B will fit the SM7. For parts information please contact our Parts Department at 800-516-2525.
