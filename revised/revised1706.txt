Question:
I think the answer to this is yes but I just want to check. Can I use UC series bodypacks with U series receivers and also the reverse? I have some instructors who want to purchase their own body packs but are balking at the U1's cost.


Answer:

	 " Can I use UC series bodypacks with U series receivers and also the reverse?" *Yes.
	
	Keep in mind that the U series will have twice as many available frequencies, be it the transmitter or the receiver.
