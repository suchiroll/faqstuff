Question:
The Shure mic inserts marked Shure MC125, which is a sealed cylinder with one only 3mm entry hole at the centre of one of the flat faces.. Do you know where I can find data on these?






Answer:

	The MC series of mic elements were discontinued in 1985. The elements were used in the products of other companies for sensing sound. An example might be a sound level meter.
	
	Our records do not indicate a model MC125. Perhaps this was a model made especially for another company and was given a unique model number.
