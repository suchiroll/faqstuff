Question:
I'm using T4N Diversity Receiver with a power supply of Model PS20E (230 VAC, 50 Hz). I noticed that there is a humming sound coming out in my speaker, especially when microphone volume is raised in my amplifier.


1) Is there any remedy to eliminate this unusual sound?


2) Is there any problem with our cycle (Hertz) in our country?


3) Is the squelch control have to do with it?

	3) No.
