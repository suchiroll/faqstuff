Title: Transmitting MIDI over U1/U4D

Question:
I would like to connect a MIDI controller (a keyboard) to a MIDI sampler. I would like to use a Shure wireless system U or SC to transmit MIDI, is that possible?


I read a FAQ answer on your site where you say "Shure does not make a wireless system that will transmit MIDI without a cable ("thread"). Try Aquila Systems in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, USA. Phone number: 215-957-5450. Unfortunately I do not speak such good English and I am in Europe, could you kindly send to me web site or e-mail address or fax number of Aquila systems if you continue not to handle MIDI wireless transmissions?

I contacted midi-classics as suggested but I received the following e-mail from Phil Sabatine of Midi-classics:

"We have been unable to contact Aquila. These pages are marked obsolete. They have not shipped anything for us in over a year. MIDIMan/MAudio will soon release a wireless MIDI system called Blue Tooth. I recommend you watch our site or MIDIMan for news on this exciting new product."


I would need soon this MIDI wireless connection, do you know any other brand producing it now?


Thanks for what you will still do for helping me.

	Shure wireless will not transmit MIDI signals.
	
	For other ideas, email Shure Europe: support@shure.de English and German are the main languages at Shure Europe.
