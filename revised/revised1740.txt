Title: Shure HTS with a DVD player
Id: 1740
Legacy Id: 1799

Question:
I have a complete Shure Theater System, including HTS5300 Decoder and all Surround Sound Amplifiers and Shure Speakers. The System is in good working order. Could you please inform me as to what is required to use this System with a DVD player for 5.1 channel surround sound application.


Answer:

	We would like to help, but Shure exited the Home Theater System market in the early 1990's. None of the engineers that designed the HTS are still employed by Shure, so we have no experts to answer your question. DVD players were introduced years after Shure left the HTS business.
