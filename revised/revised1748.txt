Question:
Concerning the basics . . . have heard two different "theories" of proper holding position for singer holding a mic. Should singer hold mic directly out in front of mouth or angled down slightly below lips?


Answer:

	The best mic technique is to hold the mic toward the corner of the mouth. This avoids blasts of breath from the nose, and P-popping from the mouth. Copy the mic technique of Frank Sinatra; it was flawless.
