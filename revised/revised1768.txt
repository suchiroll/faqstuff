Question:
I own one of your Shure wireless microphones. The unit came with a behind the head, over the ears headset with a 1/4" jack. I have used this headset for a good while now and still don't like the feel of it. I would like to try an over the head style of headset. Can you suggest which of your products would work well for this unit?



Answer:

	Check out the SM10A microphone. The headband goes over the top of the head.
	
	The SM10A XLR mic connector must be removed and replaced with a 1/4 male phone plug in order to connect the SM10A to your wireless transmitter. This is a simple procedure for any electronics technician.
