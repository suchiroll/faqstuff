Title: Choosing UHF antenna cables

Question:
My company does corporate shows. We are currently using (2) U4D recievers with the UA845 distro in a rack and the UA830 antennas with RG58A/U coax cables.From a previous question I noticed that Shure recomends the RG58C/U coax cable,or RG8X coax.

Is there a difference in the RG58C/U and the RG58A/U other than the outer jacket material?

Would there be that much of an advantage to upgrade to the RG8X coax if the cable runs are under 100'?

We also have single U4D recievers in small racks that are placed on top of the larger racks and jumped into the UA845, (sometimes 2 or 3 racks).

Are there any concerns about making different lenth jumpers for each racks height or should they all be the same lenth?


Answer:

	Is there a difference in the RG58C/U and the RG58A/U other than the outer jacket material?
	* No important difference.
	
	Would there be that much of an advantage to upgrade to the RG8X coax if the cable runs are under 100?
	* Yes. RG58 has a loss of 18 dB per 100 feet; RG8X has a loss of 12 dB per 100 feet.
	
	Are there any concerns about making different length jumpers for each racks height or should they all be the same length?
	* Different length jumpers are OK.
