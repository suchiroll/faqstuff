Question:
How do bands get the sound of their electric guitars to be amplified through the amplifiers used at concerts with a wireless system?


Answer:

	The output of the guitar goes to a wireless transmitter. The output of the receiver plugs into the input of the guitar amp. A microphone is placed in front of the guitar amp to pick it up. That microphone is run to the main mix console and through the PA in the arena.
