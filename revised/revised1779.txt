Question:
Until recently I was the proud owner of several SHURE SUPER-PRO microphones, however they were all stolen I have not been able to find anything that compares to the quality, the smooth rich tones with total crispness for clarity.DO you have any suggestions as to what might come close to the abilities of the SUPER-PRO?


Answer:

	We assume you mean the model PE50SP. If so, the SM58S is very similar to the PE50SP.
