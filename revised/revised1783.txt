Can you send me a drawing of the best way to set up SM57 on a drum kit?


Answer:

	You can find this information at the following link: http://www.shure.com/publications/AL34672_Mic_Techniques_for_Drums.pdfAsking what is the "best mic setup", is like asking "what is the best way to play drums?" There is no answer. Miking is more art than science. Use whatever miking setup sounds best to your ear.
