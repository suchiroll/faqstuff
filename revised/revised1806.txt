Title: Repair of WL50 mic
Id: 1806
Legacy Id: 1866

Question:
We very recently purchased (6) WL50 microphones. Tonight one of our actors cut and severed one of the cables on a mic. My question is in two parts.


1) Who is a local distributor for Shure in Texas?


2) And will a repair cost out weigh a replacement cost?


We have a backup microphone, but need to replace it soon. Please let me know a contact in Texas or Dallas with whom to resolve this.


Answer:

	1) See our Dealer locator.
	
	2) Repair will be less expensive than replacing the mic. The repair can only be done at Shure Service in Illinois.
