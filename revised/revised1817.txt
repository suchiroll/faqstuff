Title: Over The Ear Holder for a Wireless Mic
Id: 1817

Question:
Is there a product to discreetly hold Lavalier mics over the ear, rather than me attempting, once more, to create something with paper clips, bobby pins, etc.? It seems like there is a standard piece used by virtually every actor in almost every Broadway show, but I can't seem to find it for sale anywhere.


Answer:

	Radio Shack sells an earphone that includes an over-the-ear plastic holder. This holder can be used to mount a mic on the ear. Attached the mic to the holder with the adhesive of your choice.
