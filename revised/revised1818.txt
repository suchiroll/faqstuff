Title: Changing the frequency on a handheld transmitter
Id: 1818

Question:
I have an ACCESS AXSHWS wireless headset system. My system runs on frequency channel "CL". I have a chance to get ahold of a used Shure wireless handheld microphone, to use with my system in place of my headset, but I'm not sure of what channel it operates.


My Questions Are:

1) How can I tell what channel this handheld works on?

2) If this handheld's channel doesn't match my system's, can it be made (sent it, etc.) to match?




Answer:

	1) How can I tell what channel this handheld works on?
	* Look for a label in the battery compartment. After the model number, there will be a two letter code. It must be CL to match your receiver.
	
	2) If this handhelds channel doesnt match my systems, can it be made (sent it, etc.) to match?
