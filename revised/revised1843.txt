Question:
I want to ask you if there is something that connects my microphone in to my speaker. I want a wireless system - something that could connect my mic in to the system in to the speaker.


Answer:

	A sound system is far more than a microphone and a loudspeaker. In brief, a basic sound system consists of these components:
	
	1) Microphone (wired and/or wireless)
	2) Mixer
	3) Power amplifier
	4) Loudspeaker
	5) All the necessary cabling
