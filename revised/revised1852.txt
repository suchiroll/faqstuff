Title: Monaural Crystal Cartridge for Montgomery Ward Cabinet Radio
Id: 1852
Legacy Id: 1912

Question:
I am searching for a cartridge for my late 1940s Montgomery Ward Cabinet Radio with record changer.


The cartridge is a Shure, and has the code P27V or that's what i make of it, on the label, on the other side there is the number 942 stamped on.


It is a dual cartridge for both 33/45 rpm and 78 rpm. it is about 1/4-inch wide, with a wing on each side with a hole for a screw.


Does Shure still make antique cartridges? and if you do, can you please send me the information to purchase a cartridge with stylus.


Answer:

	Shure has not made crystal phono cartridges since the 1950s.
	
	Try Record King in New Jersey: telephone 201-488-4232 This company specializes in discontinued styli. Also check Radio Shack. They offer replacement cartridges for older turntables.
