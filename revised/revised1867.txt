Question:
We are looking for a high quality noise cancelling microphone for use in our new voice recognition exhibit. This exhibit will be located in a very noisy gallary with high ambient levels, point sources and distant voices. We need a microphone or system that will only deliver the intended voice to our voice recognition computer. Any help you could offer would be very much appreciated.


Answer:

	Consider the Shure SM10 headworn mic, the WH20XLR headworn mic, or the Shure 503BG gooseneck mic.
