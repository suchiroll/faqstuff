Question:
I have many SM57's, SM58's and 515 mics. on my repair bench. The majority of these have bad capsules. I have been told that replacement capsules are almost as expensive as purchasing a new mic., but that you offer an exchange program. Is this correct and if so, could you enlighten me as to: 1. the cost of repair. 2. the cost of exchange. 3. the process of ordering repair parts/exchanges. Thank you in advance for your help in this request.
