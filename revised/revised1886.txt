Title: SM53 locking clips
Id: 1886
Legacy Id: 1946

Question:
I'm looking for replacements for the original clips which shipped with some SM53's I bought in the 70's. They have a threaded brass stand fitting and a molded plastic barrel holding the mic, with a sliding "ring" securing the mic.

Are these still available?


Answer:

	The clip described, the A57SL, was discontinued 20 years ago. SL = Sliding Lock.  Sorry, Shure no longer has these in stock.
	
	In the current line, the choices are: A57F or A53M
