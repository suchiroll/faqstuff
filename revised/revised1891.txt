Our church is upgrading from a 18 channel mixer to a 32 channel. Due to difficulties hard wiring within the building the decision has been made to buy wireless microphones going forward.

The location of the church is 8 North Concord Ave., Havertown, PA 19083. (just west of Philadelphia)

1. Since we will have up to 14 available channels on the mixer which series would offer the most available compatable systems?

2. What would be the maximum number of systems we could use?

The dimensions of the room are aproximately 50' x 150 x 50'. There is a balcony that extends out from the rear about 25'. The sound equipment is located on the balcony.
