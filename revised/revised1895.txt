Question:
Couple of us are recording rap vocals (we already have beats) on my computer. We do this in my basement which is kinda dead. So, I was wondering which mic should we get?

1) I have been told that a dynamic one would be better because it would not pick up rooms acoustics like a condenser would. I have heard Beta 58 mics are good.

2) Which mic would you recommend?

3) Also, what else would you recommend in order to make a mic work with a sound card?

4) Any sound cards that you recommend?



Answer:

	1) False. The type of mic element has no effect.
	
	2) The Beta 58 or SM58. Either should work well.
	
	3) See below for this answer.
	
	4) No.
