Title: SHURE HTS 50LRS loudspeaker
Id: 1900
Legacy Id: 1961

Question:
I recently acquired a pair of Shure HTS speakers. They are the Model 50 LRS that I believe was part of a Pro Home Theater line that your company produced around 1989/90.


I would like to receive whatever information you can provide about this speaker. I'm particularly interested to know if it would be appropriate as a small monitor used in a stereo application or was it designed with a modified frequency response more appropriate to home theater?


Any information you can provide, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.


Answer:

	Here is all the information we have.
	
	Response: 60 Hz to 18,000 Hz (We could not find a response curve.)
	
	Sensitivity: 85dB SPL at 1 meter, on axis, with 2.83 Vac wideband pink noise input signal
	
	Power handling: 100 RMS watts maximum
	
	Impedance: 5.6 ohms nominal; 200 Hz to 18,000 Hz
	
	Crossover: Fourth order passive crossover with driver equalization and midband response correction
	
	Protection: 3 amp fast blow fuse for high frequency driver only
	
	No other information is available. We hope the above is useful to you.
