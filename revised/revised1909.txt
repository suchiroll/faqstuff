Question:
What is the difference between the BG 1.1 and the older BG 1.0 model?


Answer:

	The BG 1.1 will nearly match your BG 1.0. The differences are quite minor:
	
	BG 1.1 has an output level that is 0.5 dB greater.
	
	BG 1.1 is not a dual impedance; it is only low impedance.
	
	The BG 1.1 has different outer packaging.
