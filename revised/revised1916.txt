Question:
I have a bar in NYC. WE have a DJ booth that is mobile. We just bring it up from the basement when we need it. Currently I use a 60 ft RCA cable run from the booth to the amp. The long run affects the sound quality. I was wondering if there is a wireless solution that might work better. Any suggestions???


Answer:

	We do not recommend wireless. Instead convert the RCA output (unbalanced, high impedance) to a balanced, low impedance signal at the DJ booth. Run a balanced, low impedance cable (XLR to XLR cable) over the 60 feet. Convert the balanced low impedance signal back to an RCA output at the amp.
	
	The conversions are done using transformers. Contact Jensen Transformers. Shure does not have the productsrequired in this situation.
