Question:
I have a Industrial video camera with a 3-pin connector, 48v phantom. My question is what is a good mic. for this camera and do they make a stereo mic. because I do have 2-inputs on the back of this camera. I do a lot of weddings (High Audio) and I want it more around the camera, not so much shotgun like consumer cameras.


Answer:

	Check out the Shure VP88. It is a stereo microphone.
