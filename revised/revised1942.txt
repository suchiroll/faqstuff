Question:
We just received a 200M mixer, which works well. We would like to use it with phantom powered mics. Is there an adapter we can buy to provide this voltage to the mic?


Answer:

	There is no simple way to add phantom power to the Prologue 200M.
	
	You could replace the 200M mixer with the Shure SCM268 mixer that has internal phantom power.
