Title: SCM262 sensitivity of ducking

Question:
We are trying to make the ducking less sensitive when we have long runs of wire. The stray voltage is making the stereo 3 duck when jukebox is not playing. Is there a way to make it less sensitive?


Answer:

	Try balancing the output of the jukebox, sending a balanced signal to the SCM262, and then unbalancing the signal at the SCM262. A balanced signal will be much quieter and pick up less interference along the way. If you are interested in doing this, check out products from Radio Design Labs - the STA-1 is the product for this; one on either end of the long line.
