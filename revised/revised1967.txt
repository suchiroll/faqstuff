Title: Cartridge for Grace 707 MkIII arm
Id: 1967

Question:
Currently has 20 yr old Grace F9-L cartridge but stylus canteliever damaged. Considering M97 or M94. How different are these three? My arm is low-mass so I want high compliance. Are all 3 same compliance?


P.S. Do cartridges get stiffer with old age. At what age would you retire the entire cartridge rather than replacing the stylus assy?


Answer:

	How different are these three?

	* For your situation, the M97xE is the best choice. The M94E does not have the dynamic stablizer, which is a great feature.
	
	Are all 3 same compliance?

	* All three are very similar.
	
	Do cartridges get stiffer with old age?

	* The stylus can get stiff due to atmospheric ozone attacking the rubber bushing that supports the stylus.
	
	At what age would you retire the entire cartridge rather than replacing the stylus assy?

	* The cartridge body does not age. Replacing the stylus assembly provides like-new performance.
