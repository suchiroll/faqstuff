Title: Shure mic model #EM28B
Id: 1969
Legacy Id: 2032

Question:
Where can I get a wiring diagram for this mic?


Answer:

	Shure never sold a model EM28B under the Shure brand. Your model was made by Shure for General Electric and last sold in 1981. We have a one page sheet that shows the internal wiring of the mic, but no specifications.
