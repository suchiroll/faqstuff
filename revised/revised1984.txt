Question:
How is the stereo signal recorded on a vinyl record? I vaguely recall a combination of left-right and up-down. I've been recording 45s onto CD and noticed on some records are distorted only on the left channel. Checked signals with a scope - not caused by electronics. I'm using a 70's vintage M95ED on a Pioneer PL-530.


Answer:

	The stereo signal is recorded on a V-shaped groove. One wall of the groove has the left channel; the other wall has the right channel.
	
	If the 45 RPM record is stereo, the distortion could be caused by:
	

	
		Damage to the left channel portion of the groove.
	
		Damaged stylus tip.
	
		Improper anti-skate setting on the tonearm. The anti-skate setting should equal the tracking force.
