Question:
I'm somewhat confused after reading about cartridges and styli. I have an older R27E Cartridge and RS 5T Stylus that I intended to use for both 33s and 45s. Will this cartridge/stylus work well for 45s or do I need a separate cartrige/stylus just for 45s?


Answer:

	The R27E Cartridge and RS 5T Stylus will work fine for 45 RPM records.
