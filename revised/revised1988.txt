Question:
I am interested in the Shure 512. I wanted to know if there was a way to connect the headset unit directly to the telephone. I am looking to replace the telephone handset.


Answer:

	Sorry, the 512 cannot be connected directly to a telephone.
	
	We suggest you contact a Plantronics. This company specializes in after-market headsets for telephones: http://www.plantronics.com/
