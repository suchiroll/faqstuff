Question:
I intend to set up a turntable with your M78S cartridge which is monophonic. My turntable currently has one of your better stereo cartridges in it with 4 prongs which connect to 4 wires. Does your M78S cartridge also have 4 prongs which I can put the 4 wires on? And what is the function of the two wire jumpers supplied with the M78S?

Answer:

	The M78S cartridge does have 4 prongs.   The two bronze jumpers (Shure part #44D119A) are used to tie together LEFT to RIGHT, and LEFT GROUND to RIGHT GROUND.  This puts the two internal coils in parallel and provide a monaural output for use with a monaural tone arm. 
	A single jumper can also be used to tie together the internal coils in series.  For a series connection, have LEFT GROUND tie to RIGHT.   Use LEFT as one connection point for the tonearm, and RIGHT GROUND as the other connection point for the tonearm.
	The M78S pin functions, from the top to the bottom are: Left - Right - Left Ground - Right Ground.
