Title: Manufacturing info about mic grills
Id: 2006

Question:
I realize that this is a very unusual query, but I’m curious nonetheless:


How is the grille of the Beta 58A made: i.e. how is the mesh attached to the grill-rings? I presume it is welded to the rings by means of a resistance welding or similar process. I see that apparently not all of the wires have formed a successful bond with the middle and base rings, where they meet. Is this normal, and what percentage of successful mesh-wire to ring welds would be considered acceptable during manufacturing? Have you ever come across a grill failure (i.e. coming apart) due to impact to a microphone, e.g. falling?


You’re response would be greatly appreciated!
