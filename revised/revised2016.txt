Question:
My Mic Pre is too hot for the input of my ADAT (when getting the sound I want out of it). Does Shure manufacture a transparent attenuator for between the 1/4 inch output of the mic pre and the 1/4 inch input of the ADAT (unbalanced?)?


Answer:

	No, we do not. Our only in-line attenuator is the A15AS. It is XLR balanced to XLR balanced.
