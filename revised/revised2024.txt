Title: Lavalier tie clip accessories needed

Question:
We have a lavalier that says 84A on the mic. Apparently this model is discontinued and I need to find a clip to fit it in and the correct windscreen. I've looked all over town and no one has what we need. When I look at the different accessories you have I really don't know what goes with what or if it matters. The clip on we have holds the mic in a four prong grip. I haven't seen any like this on the web site and don't know if other clips will do just as good. Could you recommend what is compatable.


Answer:

	The microphone is a model WL84A. New tie clips can be purchased from our Parts Department at 800-516-2525. The part number is RK240SB. It contains four clips; each holds a single WL84A.
