Question:
I would like to know if Beta 58A microphone can be wireless.


Answer:

	A wired Beta 58A can only be made wireless by connecting it to one of our bodypacks using the WA310 cable.
	
	There is no way to modify a wired Beta 58A to make it a wireless handheld microphone.
	
	Most of our wireless systems are available with the wireless version of the Beta 58A cartridge.
