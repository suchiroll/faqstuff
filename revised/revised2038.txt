Question:
I already have the shure PSM600 hard wired system. Is there a way to turn it into a wireless system without having to re-buy the belt pack? For instance, can I just buy the transmitter and an antenna for my beltpack and be set?


Answer:

	Unfortunately, no. They are completely different.
