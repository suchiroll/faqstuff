Question:
I'm a singing drummer in a progressive band. I have always been curious about wireless headsets. However I have never had the chance to actually try one. I currently use the Shure Beta 87A and I was wondering which headset is the "best". If you could possibly give me 2 or 3 picks. Price is no object. I want the best sounding mic I can get my hands on...or head on, for that matter.


Answer:

	When compared to a Beta 87, we believe all headworn mics will disappoint.
	
	In the Shure line, try the Beta 54wireless headworn mic. TheBeta 54is currently the best sounding headworn mic in the Shure line that can be used for live sound. But make certain you directly compare it to whatever wired mic you prefer, like the Beta 87.
	
	The technology does not yet exist that can make a tiny headworn mic sound as good as a handheld mic like the Beta 87. However, we are working hard at creating that technology.
