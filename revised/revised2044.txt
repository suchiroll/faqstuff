Question:
I have an Audio Technica wireless system. My questions are... 1) Does the WBH53 Headset microphone plug into the Audio Technica wireless body pack which has the mini 4 wire connector 2) If not, can I attach a 1/4" plug to the WBH53BX to plug it into either a mixer, or the wireless body pack? 3) If I use the 1/4" connector to terminate the WBH53BX, will I notice signal loss when coupling via a barrel connector (1/4" female to 1/4" female) to allow plugging into the wireless body pack?
