Question:
I've heard the KSM32 and like it very much - and they've been VERY well received! How are the KSM44 and KSM27 different in terms of sonic quality from the KSM32? For my home studio cost is a factor, but the "right" mic for vocals and instruments is most important.


Answer:

	The KSM44 and KSM27 sound very similar to each other. The KSM32 has an extremely neutral, uncolored sound to it. The KSM27 and KSM44 have a bit more warmth and body to them.
	
	We suggest that you visit your local Shure dealer to try them. Sound is very subjective. Only you can decide which mic you like best.
