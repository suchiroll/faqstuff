Question:
I have a Sony VX2000 minidv camcorder. Can I use the SM93 microphone with this kind of cameras? I don´t know if I need phantom entries to power it (this camera hasn´t got...) . if so, how can I give energy to the mic? thanks


Answer:

	You will need an interface such as theBeachtek or JuicedLink interfaces.

	The SM93 requires phantom power. The interface is necessary to supply the phantom power.
