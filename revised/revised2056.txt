Question:
Hi, I am looking to buy a couple of overhead drum mics. I notice that a lot of people are using the KSM32's but now that the KSM27's are out would those be as good? I don't mind spending the extra cash if the KSM32's sound better but if the KSM27's sound very similar than I would like to save a little money and get the KSM27's. Thanks for your time!


Answer:

	The KSM27 does sound slightly different than the KSM32. We recommend that you visit your local Shure dealer to try both and determine which one you like the sound of. To see which microphones we recommend for overhead, see our online Selection Guide at: Which microphone should I use on ... ? (Selection Guides)
