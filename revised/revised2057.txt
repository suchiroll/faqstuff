Question:
I am wondering if the N95ED stylus would fit into the M55E cartridge before I make a purchase. Using the SME3009II pickup arm that tracks to a max. 1.5gm. I understand the N95E has a 0.75 - 1.5gm tracking force so it should not be a problem. Only if it fits.



Answer:

	The N95ED will not work properly in the M55E cartridge. 
	The  N55E stylus is the proper replacement stylus for the M55E.
