Question:
I am interested in purchasing a good recording microphone. Which mic is better the SM58S or the Beta 58A? I need something to deliver a nice clear sound. I'm going to be recording at home.


Answer:

	This is similar to asking, "Which is better, green or blue?" Some people like green, some people like blue. Only your ears can decide which microphone you like better. This is also going to be dependent on what sounds you are trying to record.
	
	We suggest that you visit your local Shure dealer and listen to both microphones to hear which one you like.
	
	To see what microphones we recommend for recording various sounds, see our online Selection Guides.
