Question:
I want to get one of the top of the line cartridges for my turntable. will playing records with scratches damage the cartridge. I'm thinking I should have two cartridges, one for good records, and one for bad records.

I was wondering about wear to the cartridge, not the stylus. I mis phrased my original question.



Answer:

	The stylus tip is a diamond. The record is vinyl. Scratches in vinyl will not increase the wear of the diamond tip.

	Only the stylus wears out due to the friction of riding in the groove.
