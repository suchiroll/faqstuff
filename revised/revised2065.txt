Question:
What isthe range of tracking force for the V15VxMR without the dynamic stabilizer (I know that optimum is 1.0 grams) and if 1.25 grams would be excessive. Thanks very much.



Answer:

	The tracking force range is 0.75 grams to 1.25 grams.
	
	If the stabilizer is in use, add 0.5 grams to the tracking force setting. This is because the upward force of the stabilizer decreases the tracking force by 0.5 grams.
