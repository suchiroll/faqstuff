Question:
I own A Taylor 814C Acoustic Guitar with a Fishman on board blender through a Trace Elliott 50R Acoustic Digital Amplifier. I use the setup at home and for small club use (up to 50 people). I know precious little about amplification and microphones and woud like some advice on what microphone to consider. I want to run the Mic through the Trace Elliott as well as the guitar. The type of guitar/vocal sound I want is James Taylor / Paul Simon etc.

	Consider the following vocal mics:

	KSM9
	Beta 87A
	Beta 58A
	SM58
