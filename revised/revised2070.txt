Question:
Just bought Shure SM58 mics over the internet. I've seen ads stating that mic came from "non-smoking studio," but did not pay much attention. The mics I got came from a heavy smoking environment. What effect might smoke have on the condenser elements and if something can be done, what?

Answer:

	Unlikely that the performance will be affected.
	
	How should I clean my microphone?
