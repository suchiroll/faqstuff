Question:
I am a research scientist interested in exploiting the sound generated by animals (cattle, sheep, goats) grazing/foraging. My technique entails placing a microphone on the head somewhere (currently facing inwards against the skull) to pick up biting and chewing jaw movements, connected to a wireless transmitter, and picking up the signal with a receiver attached to a video camera or tape deck. I am interested in buying new equipment for this project. I want to try two approaches: single microphone and two microphone systems (placing the mics at two different places on the body of the animal). Could you recommend Shure equipment that might be suitable for such purposes?


Answer:

	1) To determine what microphone to use, we need to know the frequency range of the foraging sounds. Can you provide the lowest frequency and highest frequency of interest?
	
	2) Wireless laws vary in each country. Please contact the Shure agent in Israel to find out what wireless systems are legal.
