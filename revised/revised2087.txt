Question:
I need your help! I am a mobile disc jockey from San Jose California (San Francisco Bay Area). I would like to know which unit would you recommend for my area? I do walk around a good distance when in use. Help! Your advice would greatly be appreciated! I'm confused about the UHF and VHF.
