Question:
We are working with a system that requires Shure MX391C mics to be integrated into a wireless system. The client has currently 1 LX4 receiver and 1 SC4 receiver. They wish us to make these work with a mixer (no issue so far) and hard wire the MX391's to Body Pack Transmitters (again, no problem we can wire into the body pack)

Question.. will the use of 2 different type or models of receivers (LX4 and SC4) cause any issue?

Q#2.. We will obviously require a LX1 body pack transmitter for the LX4 and a SC1 BPT for the SC4?


Answer:

	The LX transmitter and the SC transmitter are wired the same. Either will power the MX391. NOTE: The MX391 in-line preamp is not required when using the MX391 with a wireless transmitter.
	
	The audio outputs of the LX4 receiver and the SC4 receiver are nearly identical.
	
	Yes, make certain to use an LX1 for the LX4 and a SC1 for the SC4.
