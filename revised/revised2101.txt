Question:
I'm looking for a microphone that will capture sounds like police car sirens, bowling pins being knocked down, pigs grunting etc. I'm going to be plugging it into a minidisc recorder. Any suggestions would be gratefully received.

Thank you.


Answer:

	Assuming you want to record in stereo, the VP88.
