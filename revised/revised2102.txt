Question:
Just bought a new SM57 and the top of the mike rotates to the touch. Is this normal? Should it be fixed?


Answer:

	Absolutely normal! Do not try to fix; it is not broken.
	The rotating grill was part of the original industrial design on the model 545.  The design provided a reliable method to securely mount a grill to the end of the mic.  The rotation was simply a "side-effect" of the mounting method.
