I was wondering about the Shure 14A. What does T1, T2 stand for? About the price, is it really $690.00? Because a few months ago I bought the same brand and it cost about $400.00. If it is possible can I just buy then microphones and the transmitter itself without the T1 thing that comes along.

thank you


Answer:

	At 12/04/2001 08:34 AM we wrote - The 14A is the microphone element used on the end of the T2 handheld transmitter.
	
	T1 is the bodypack transmitter.
	
	T2 is the handheld transmitter.
	
	$690 is the suggested retail price in the United States as of June 2001.
	
	The T288 system includes two T2 handheld transmitters and no T1 bodypack transmitters.
