Question:
I have a Shure M81MC cartridge, where the stylus is a N75C type. The stylus has broken off, and I am in need of a replacement. I don't see this cartridge, nor sytlus type listed. What are the allowable replacement stylus types for this cartridge.


Answer:

	Use the N75B Type 2 replacement stylus. Note that its tracking range is 1.5 to 3 grams. The N75C stylus tracked at 3 to 5 grams.
