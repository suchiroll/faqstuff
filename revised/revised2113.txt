Question:
I would like to use this old 580SA Unidyne A unit on my Ibanez TA25 acoustic amp in the XLR plug. Need wiring info to avoid mishaps.


Answer:

	Internally rewire the 580SA (high impedance) so that it becomes a 580SB (low impedance). The schematics are on the 580SA data sheet.
	The male XLR is wired: shield to pin 1; white to pin 2; black to pin 3.
