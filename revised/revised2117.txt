Question:
I just bought a "Shure 55SH" and I'd like to know more about history stuff. When did it come on the market? which singer use it for the first time and so on? I'm very happy about my new microphone it really look great and I think I'm gonna sing better now.


Answer:

	The first model 55 was introduced in 1939. There have been many variations on the same design since then. In 2009, the Super 55 was introduced.
	
	We have no idea who used it for the first time.
