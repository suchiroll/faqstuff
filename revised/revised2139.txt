Question:
Does the UP4 Reciever fit between the camera and the Anton Bauer battery and reciever will be powered by the A/B battery?


Answer:

	Per Paul Sullivan of Anton Bauer:
	
	To mount the UP4 receiver to an Anton Bauer Gold Mount battery requires two products from Anton Bauer:
	
	A) One Backplate; there are two models - one for a Sony camera, the other for a JVC or Panasonic camera.
	
	B) One ABWMK-KIT universal wireless receiver mounting kit. The UP4 mounting box attaches to this piece.
	
	The UP4 does have an DC power jack for powering from an external battery.
