Question:
I'm an amateur radio operator. I'm looking for a microphone that has good sound qualities and will tailor my voice in the mid range region. I don't want to use a communication microphone. Can I adapt a studio mic for this use?


Answer:

	As sound is subjective, we cannot predict which mic will appeal to your ear. The SM7B studio mic is often used by ham radio operators.
	
	It requires the use of a high quality mic preamp.
