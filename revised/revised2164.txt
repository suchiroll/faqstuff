Title: Wireless clip-on instrument mic for trumpet
Id: 2164

Question:
I have a Shure Wireless System - the components are:


T4G Diversity Receiver - Guitar

T1G Guitarist Transmitter

PS20 Power Supply Adapter


I used the above with an AKG clip-on instrument mic, which I plugged into an AKG B9 Battery Power Supply that plugs into the T1G Transmitter. I don't use the AKG mic or the battery transmitter anymore as they have had cable prolems and I don't want two devices clipped on my belt.


I understand that the system I have is designed for guitar, and this particular transmitter cannot drive a condenser-type mic.


Can you recommend a good clip-on instrument mic (for a trumpet) that I can use with this system that doesn't require the additional battery pack? What other options do I have?


Thanks in advance for your reply.

Answer:

	You can buy a T1 transmitter on the same frequency as your T4G receiver. The T1 has a four pin input unlike the T1G transmitter.
	For the mic, get the WM98KCS. It will plug directly into the T1.
	
	The WM98KCS is being replaced by the WB98H/C. Either might be available from Shure dealers in your area. Buy whichever sounds better to your ear.
