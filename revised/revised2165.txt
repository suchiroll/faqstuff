Question:
I have a BSR MacDonald turntable purchased in 1970 or 1971. It has a cartridge clearly marked M44MB, and I know it is a Shure. It has never been replaced, and the needle is very old. I'd like to replace both. What do I need to buy, and where can I get it? I also need instructions on rebalancing the arm. Thanks.



Answer:

	Which phono cartridge will fit my turntable?
