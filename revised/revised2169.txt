Question:
Hello. I am currently building a home recording studio and basically know nothing about mics (other than Shure products are surely the mics to buy. Anyway, I would like your opinion on mic product selection for the following applications:


1. Drum miking- We plan to use 6 to 8 mics to record a drum kit. Which models would you recommend for a mid price, high quality recording. Please explain which model should record which drum(s).


2. Vocal mic- We have a female singer need to make sure that her beautiful voice is transferred to the recording equipment properly. Which mic(s) would you recommend?


3. Guitar amp- Our guitars plays a wide range of styles in our music...from crunchy heavy nonsense to sweet melodic melodies to funked up funkin funk. Please advise.
