Title: Neck Strap for Lavalier Mic
Id: 2182

Question:
I have a Shure LX14/83. Instead of the tie clip, I would like to use a neck strap. Do you make an accessory for the lavalier mic that would do this?


Answer:

	Sorry, we do not.

	Get a simple chain or cloth lanyard at a hobby shop and attach the mic to the lanyard using the tie clip. The WL183 mic is omnidirectional and does not need to be aimed at the mouth.
