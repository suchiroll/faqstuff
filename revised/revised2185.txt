Question:
I'm presently going to purchase 2 of your microflex gooseneck microphones for use in our house of worship. The spec sheet data states that these are condensor microphones and are built with a term "electret" microphone. Does this have any affect on using them with the phantom power of the mixer I am using, in other words is there an additional power source such as a battery or other power I must use as well at the podium where it is mounted?


Can I just power these gooseneck mics (MX series) with just the phantom power provided by the mixer? or do I need another pre-amp as well...



Answer:

	The phantom power from your mixer is all that is required to power the Microflex models.
