Question:
I have a MX202 with a damaged cable (an overzealous janitor with vacuum cleaner). What is the best way to repair the cable?



Answer:

	The MX202 cable is permanently attached at the microphone end. Therefore, it cannot be removed.
	
	We do not recommend splicing due to the possibility of RF interference.
	
	We suggest the MX202 be returned to Shure Service where it will likely be replaced for a service fee.
	
	Contact our Service Department at 800-516-2525 or 847-600-2000. Information concerning service, repair, parts and warranty of Shure products can be found at the following link:
