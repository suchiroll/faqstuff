Title: EZB/C & EZB/O Polar Patterns - Orientation
Id: 2202
Legacy Id: 2278

Question:
I would like to know if the polar patterns for the EZB's are spherical (measured in free space) or semispherical (measured with microphone on a flat surface)? And how they are oriented with the microphone body, is the cardioid pattern directed up from the microphone body or out in front of the microphone body?


Answer:

	The polar patterns are free space. When the mic is placed on a large, flat surface, the polar patterns are sliced in half, so the omni becomes a hemispherical pattern because the surface blocks the sound, not because the pattern has magically altered.
	
	The cardioid pattern comes off the front of the mic body, aimed at the talker. The horizontal pick up angle is 120 degrees and the vertical is 60 degrees; again sliced in half by the surface.
