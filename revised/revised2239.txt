Question:
Is there a low profile way of mounting a microphone on a grand piano?


Answer:

	Consider the Piano Barre. It fits over the piano soundboard. Mics mounted on the Piano Barre can be moved to a variety of locations.
	
	* Shure was informed in January 2017 that the Piano Barre is no longer manufactured. An alternative is: The Piano Mount
