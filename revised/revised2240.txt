Question:
What is ducking in a mixer?


Answer:

	A simple example is in the SCM262 mixer. Background music is fed into input #3. A paging mic is fed into input #1.
	
	When the paging mic is turned on and spoken into, the background music is ducked (lowered in level) so the page can be heard.
	
	When the mic is turned off, the background music returns to its original level.
