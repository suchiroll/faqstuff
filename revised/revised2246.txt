Question:
I recently bought a 520DX mic for playing harmonica and love it. The manual says I may need an A95U to convert to low impedance.
1) Is the A95U a simple to use small part I can plug in, carry in my gig bag?
2) Using this part will I still be able to use the volume control on the 520DX mic?
3) I've been playing thru a keyboard amp that also works for acoustic guitar and vocals and it sounds fine. Is a keyboard amp generally low or high impedance amp?


Answer:

	1. Yes, it is small enough for your gig bag.
	2. Yes, you can still use the volume control.
	3. A keyboard amp is likely high impedance. Check with the manufacturer.
