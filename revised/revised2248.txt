Title: Foam for inside of the SM58 microphone grill
Id: 2248
Legacy Id: 2329

Question:
Do you sell just the foam that is inside the grills for SM58's and Beta 58's?


Answer:

	Sorry, we do not. The grills are purchased by Shure with the foam installed, so we do not stock just the foam.  For replacement parts, please contact our Service Department at 800-516-2525.
