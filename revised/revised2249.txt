Question:
I recently bought a Shure microphone with an AXS6 model identification band around it, but it was a display model and had no specs with it. I can't seem to find any reference to a model AXS6 on your website.


Answer:

	It is exactly the same as the BG 6.1, except it was packaged for the Guitar Center store chain, using the Axcess brand name.
