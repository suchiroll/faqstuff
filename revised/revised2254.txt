Question:
This is for our drummer. Two questions. One: Will I need to buy a cable with this headset to reach my PA 25 feet away? If so male on both ends? AND TWO: Is this the same quality mic as like the SM58? If there is a better one for our singing drummer -- or if you suggest a mic on a boom instead for live, please advise. We have 4 Shure mics and counting.


Answer:

	1. Yes, he will need a 25 foot extension cable.
	
	2. Female XLR on one end; male XLR on the other. Mic cables are normally configured this way.
	
	3. No, the SM10 will not sound as good as the SM58. It will require bass boost from the mixer.
	
	4. An SM58 on a boom will sound better, but not be as convenient to use. If he sings background, the SM10 should be fine. For lead singing, the SM10 may not be good enough.
