Question:
I need to specify a microphone to be used in a church for a chorus located on one of its side and with no more than 7 singers.


I have seen a Shure mic Model 8700, that is not listed on your web page info, any recommendation about it.


Answer:

	The User Guide for the 8700 can be found at the following link, under C Series:
