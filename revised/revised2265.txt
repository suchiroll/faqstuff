Question:
I have a 8-track hard disk recorder which specifications are 1/4" balanced phone jacks, nominal level -50 dBu, nominal impedance 4.0k.


I'm recording Hip-Hop music (Rap and RB)and burning it to CD. The SM57 seemed like a good choice because of its reputation and ability to focus on the main sound source and not pick up background noises. Also the SM7B seems like a good choice because it can handle close up use. Or do I need a mic like the KSM27 or KSM32? I thank you for your help and knowledge on this mater.


Answer:

	We see no reason to start out with the SM7, the KSM27 or the KSM32.

	
	Start with the SM57 and the A2WS windscreen, or the SM58. Either can be obtained for under $150 and are great all-around mics.
	
	Consider upgrading to the SM7 or KSM mics IF you become dissatisifed with the SM57 or SM58, or want a different sound. But that may not happen; many great albums have been recorded using just the SM57 and SM58.
	
	Since your 1/4 inputs are balanced, make certain that the mic cables you buy are also wired balanced.
