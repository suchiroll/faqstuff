Question:
I was thinking of getting a Beta 98/S to mic my banjo and papoose (little guitar.) Would this be the best mic or should I opt for something else? Mobility is not too demanding, meaning wireless is not necessary.


Answer:

	Any reason you have to mount the mic on the instrument? This leads to lots of mechanical noise being transferred into the microphone.
	
	We suggest a flat response condenser mic (KSM137; SM81; SM94) mounted on a floor stand. Then the only connection between the mic and the instrument is acoustical.
