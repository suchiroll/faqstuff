Question:
After 16 years or so my V15 type V has slightly fallen apart. The adhesive which held the cartridge body onto the mounting hardware has come loose. I believe the cartridge is still in fine shape, unfortunately it's no longer usable. How can I reglue it?


Answer:

	We suggest a clear epoxy. Nothing special - just go to your local hardware store.

	Clean off the old adhesive for the metal body and the plastic shell. Slightly roughen each surface with fine sandpaper so the epoxy can grip. Apply a small amount of epoxy to both surfaces. Clamp it and let set for 24 hours.
