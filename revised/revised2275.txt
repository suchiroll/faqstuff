Question:
I'm looking at the SCM810 manual. The connector block to the left of #8 channel is the mixed microphone output, correct? It is the connection to the input on my sound card or other recording device, yes?


Answer:

	The connector block to the left of #8 channel is the mixed microphone output, correct?
	* Yes. It is the main output of the mixer. It will contain the signals of all nine inputs on the SCM810.
	
	It is the connection to the input on my sound card or other recording device, yes?
	* Yes. It is a line level output (about 1 volt), not a mic level output (about .001 volt).
