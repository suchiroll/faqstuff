Question:
With the MX391/O, and using a feedback destroyer by Behringer, does it go in at mic level or line level?


Answer:

	1. The MX391/O provides a mic level output, not a line level output.
	
	2. The MX391/O must be connected to a device that provides 11 to 52 volts of phantom power.
	
	3. Behringer is a competitor to Shure. It is highly unlikely that its Feedback Destroyer has a mic level input that also provides phantom power. Please check with Behringer.
