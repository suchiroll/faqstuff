Question:
I have a couple of PE55 microphones. Is it possable to buy the foam screen that goes inside of the microphone?


Answer:

	The foam used inside of the Shure model 55SH Series II will likely be a close fit to the PE55. Call Shure Parts to inquiry about the foam for the 55SH Series II: 800-516-2525.
