Question:
I sing bass in a southern gospel quartet. On the very low notes I don't have much volume. Would a SM87A with phantom power help me out on the low notes to make it sound stronger?

Answer:

	The SM87A is used by many bass singers. But sound is subjective and we cannot predict if the SM87A will satisfy your ear. Go to a Shure dealer and try it out side by side with your current mic. We also recommend listening to the Beta 87A.
