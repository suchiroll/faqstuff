Question:
Hello my friends, this is a great site you have!

I saw someone ask a question about the SM94 for live etc. and you pointed him to the look at the (best better) category in that the SM94 had a better rating however in your Performance and Recording Microphone Selection Guide it is not even listed for acoustic guitar, why not, nor is the SM57??.

2nd question, I had several acoustic players said before they went to plug in's they used the SM57 they said it had nearly the same F.R. of the higher priced SM94 and had quite a nice acoustic response. Can you tell me why the SM94 would be better for my needs or not. HELP!!


Answer:

	A condensor mic, like the SM94, typically sounds better on an acoustic guitar than a dynamic mic, like the SM57.

	
	Mic selection is a personal choice. If you like how the SM57 sounds on your guitar, great! Use it.
