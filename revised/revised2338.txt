Question:
I have a SCM810 and want to EXTERNALLY drop the line-level output from the mixer to mic level output for use with a mic input on a sound card. I know there is an internal mod to do this in the SCM810 but I'd rather not alter the mixer.


Answer:

	The Shure A15LA attenuator does this function. It is an XLR in / XLR out device.
