Question:
I have a Shure M24H phonograph cartridge and the N24H stylus for my JVC direct drive turntable. It appears that these items are no longer avaliable. What newer cartridge and stylus can I use to be able to play my quadraphonic records?


Answer:

	Shure no longer makes a phono cartridge suitable for quadraphonic records. Nor are we aware of any competitive product for quadraphonic.
	
	We suggest you have a new stylus made for you by The Expert Stylus Company. Custom made styli or stylus re-tipping
