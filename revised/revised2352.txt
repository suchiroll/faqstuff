Question:
I have an SM57 and an Audio Technica microphone that requires phantom power, and I'm wondering if I run my phantom power through the SM57 if any damage will come from it?


Answer:

	The SM57 is a dynamic microphone. A professional, balanced, dynamic microphone will not be damaged by phantom power. It will ignore it.
