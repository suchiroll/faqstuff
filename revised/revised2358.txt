Question:
I have a V15VxMR to use on my Denon DP37F turntable. When I install the cartrige I will not be able to use the Dynamic Stabilizer because my tone arm is microprocessor controlled and therefore when you adjust the tracking force it automatically adjusts the anti-skating to the same value. I know if I had seperate controls the tracking force would be set at 1.5g and the anti-skating would be set at 1g when using the Stabilizer. Since I can't adjust the controls in that manner I will just leave the Stabilizer in the "up" position and set the tracking/anti-skating control at 1g-------Correct?

I also would like to know is there any reason that I would need the use of the Stabilizer under normal playing conditions? My records are all in great shape and I do not have any warped records. Is the V15VxMR cartrige more prone to mistracking without the Stabilizer?

	* The stabilizer brush also cleans the record and removes any static charge.
