Question:
What is the maximum recommended cable length for the SM63? Is the maximum recommended length shorter for dynamic mics than for condenser mics?


Answer:

	Assuming the SM63 will be connected to a balanced, low impedance input, the mic cable can be thousands of feet in length. The same applies to a condenser microphone with a low impedance, balanced output.
