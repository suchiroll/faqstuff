Question:
I am about to purchase 6 suspended choir mics for our church. I have a local dealer that has let me test the Beta 98 miniature mics. I was impressed at the "gain before feedback" that these mics exhibited. I have not tried the MX202 series. My questions are:

1. Compare the MX202 vs Beta 98 for this application. Pros  cons.

2. What is the highest professional quality, miniature suspended mic Shure offers for suspended choir pickup?


Answer:

	1. Compare the MX202 vs Beta 98 for this application. Pros  cons.
	* No need. The Beta 98 is designed for close miking of very loud instruments. It is NOT a good choice for choir miking.
	
	2. What is the highest professional quality, miniature suspended mic Shure offers for suspended choir pickup?
