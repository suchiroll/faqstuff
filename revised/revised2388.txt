Question:
I have a 1946 Philco Radio/Phono model 46-1203 which has, I believe, a D10 changer. It appears the crystal cartridge is in need of replacement. I'm not sure of the model number, however on the

Shure manufacture sticker, only one number is printed: 28-105. The label doesn't indicate that the number is a model number. Can you cross refrence this, replace it, or repair it?


Answer:

	Shure no longer makes crystal phono cartridges. See the following link: Replacement Styli for ceramic or crystal cartridges
