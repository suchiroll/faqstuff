Question:
Thanks for a lot of good products that I have been using in my profession as a musician , as well as a hobbyist 78 collector. I have a tonearm of the make Shure Transcriptor mod.no M236. It is a pivot type. On the weight, it says patent pending, and I don't know if there actually were any patents. Also , I could not find this arm among your discontinued products. I need to find a replacement shell for this arm, and if the connection is a standard of some kind, it would be helpful to know which one.


Answer:

	Shure last sold the model M236 in the 1970's. Sorry, it is too old; the M236 is an antique. Shure cannot repair it and Shure does not have parts for it.
	
	We can mail you a specification sheet for the M236 if that would be helpful.
