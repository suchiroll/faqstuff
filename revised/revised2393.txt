Question:
I was wondering what the differences were between the SM  PG or PGAseries microphones. I have used SM58  SM57's for quite a while now, and just recently I saw in the store the PGA58  PGA57's. I purchased them to give them a try, and other than substituting plastic parts for metal, is there that big of a difference. They appear to have the same specifications. My question is referring to durability and performance.


Answer:

	The PG or PGA series are an entry level series, while the SM series is a mid level series.
	
	The performance of the SM series is better, when comparing frequency response, polar response, handling noise, transient response, etc.
	
	They both pass the same drop test and environmental tests.
