Question:
I've recently purchased BG 5.1 microphone.I have a few questions about it's battery:

1. Is the battery active all the time when it's in the microphone, or only when the switch is "on"?

2. How am I supposed to know when it's time to replace the battery (I suppose that I don't have to count the hours when I use it)?

3. I've noticed that microphone changes it's characteristicts when I'm singing for 2-3 hours(it becomes less clear, and makes some strange "ringing"), and I don't know if it means that battery is weak?


Maybe it's because I'm singing very close to the microphone(with my lips on the grille-I must, because I work very close to the speakers,don't ask why), and humidity from my mouth causes this problem?


Can I damage the microphone this way (I've read in specifications that humidity over 95% could be a problem)?

Does that mean that I can't use it for singing so close to mouth?


Answer:

	1. Is the battery active all the time when it's in the microphone, or only when the switch is "on"?
	* The battery is always active.
	
	2. How am I supposed to know when it's time to replace the battery (I suppose that I don't have to count the hours when I use it)?
	* Replace the battery once every year. The exact date is your decision. Use an alkaline battery.
	
	3. I've noticed that microphone changes it's characteristicts when I'm singing for 2-3 hours(it becomes less clear, and makes some strange "ringing"), and I don't know if it means that battery is weak?
	* This has nothing to do with the battery. It could be the foam windscreen in the grill becoming saturated with moisture from your breath.
	
	Maybe it's because I'm singing very close to the microphone(with my lips on the grille-I must, because I work very close to the speakers,don't ask why), and humidity from my mouth causes this problem?
	* This is the likely cause.
	
	Can i damage the microphone this way (I've read in specifications that humidity over 95% could be a problem)?
	* No. Once it dries out, it will be fine.
	
	Does that mean that I can't use it for singing so close to mouth?
	* No, but you may need a replacement grill so that you can change the grill after every set. This allows one to dry out while you are using the other grill.
