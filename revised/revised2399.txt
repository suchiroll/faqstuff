Question:
What is the difference?


I have the older version now and suspect elastomer failure in process in the suspension.


Will the new stylus replace the old?


Should I go all the way to a 2002 cartridge and why?



Answer:

	What is the difference?
	* A minor difference in the high frequency response.
	
	Will the new stylus replace the old?
	* No. You require the VN5MR.
	
	Should I go all the way to a new cartridge and why?
	* No. The difference is slight and not worth the extra expense to most customers.
