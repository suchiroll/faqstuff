Question:
I have purchased the WH20XLR, I am trying to use it in the same connection to the PA as the SM58 I have been using. But I have use so much gain that it just doesn't seem right. What am I missing? Is a booster required?


Answer:

	1. The WH20 does have less output than the SM58.
	
	2. The WH20 must be positioned within 1/2 inch or less from the corner of your mouth for proper operation.
	
	3. Even with proper positioning, the WH20 will require about 10 to 15 dB more gain from your mixer to equal the SM58 output. Why? Because the WH20 has a much smaller magnet than the SM58; and the magnet size directly determines the output level.
