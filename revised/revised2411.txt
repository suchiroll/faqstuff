Question:
I recently viewed a product for sale on EBay called a microphone XLR distributor. However, I cannot find any information about this product. It is listed as a Shure product, and the picture shows a Shure logo on it. If someone could provide me more information on this product: is it a current or discontinued product, or is it a fake product that Shure has never manufactured?


Answer:

	Shure never made this product. See the Turtle logo on the bottom; that was the brand name of this product. Shure bought a small quantity and had our name silk-screened on the top. These were given to Shure dealers to demonstrate microphones.
	
	The Turtle was made by Venetti Co., 543 N. Windsor Blvd., Los Angeles CA 90004.
