Question:
I am currently using a Technicks SL1300 Turn Table. and a McIntosh C15 Preamplifier. This Preamplifer supports only a moving magnet cartridge.


Please advise me the model numbers of the moving magnet cartridges that Shure Manufactures.


I have visitied you distributor "Melody Corner" in Dubai but they were not able to help me. They Sold me a M97XE. Is this suitable for my amplifier?


I look forward to hear from you soon.


Answer:

	All Shure phono cartridges are a moving magnet design. The M97xE is a superb choice for your hi-fi system.
