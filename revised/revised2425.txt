Question:
Which mics are best to use and where should I place them for live reinforcement and recording of our church orchestra? Right now we have severalBG4.1 micsand we get a lot of brass on our woodwinds!


Answer:

	To see what microphones we recommend for orchestra, please see our online Selection Guide at:
	Selection Guides
	
	The BG 4.1 is a fine choice for miking an orchestra.
	
	If the mics are picking up too much brass, then you have the following two choices:
	
	1) Move the microphones closer to the woodwinds.
	2) Get the orchestra to balance better acoustically. That is, have the brass play softer.
