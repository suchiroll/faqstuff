Question:
I have an M44-7 from 20 to 25 years ago and would like to replace the stylus primarily with the N78S. Is this compatible? Also, just what is a DJ cartridge?


Answer:

	The plastic grip of the N78S stops it from fitting into the old M44-7 body. If  you own a Dremel drill, you can grind down the plastic on the body or on the stylus grip, and then you can use the N78S.
	
	We suggest you grind down the plastic on the body. If you grind the stylus grip, you will void the warranty.
