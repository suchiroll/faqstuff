Question:
I have been told that you cannot use stage monitors with the KSM microphones because of its sensitivity.


I want to get one for our country/bluegrass band to use on the stage but feel the need for stage monitors for a live performance is necessary.


Can monitors be used with the KSM27 or 32?


Answer:

	Can monitors be used with the KSM27 or 32?
	* Yes. Allison Krause and Union Station use the KSM32 live.
	
	When using a KSM mic at a distance, can the monitors be turned up as loud as when we use SM58 mics pressed up against our lips?
	* No.
	
	Why?
	*It's those darn laws of physics. If the KSM mic were also pressed up against your lips, then it could be as loud as the SM58.
