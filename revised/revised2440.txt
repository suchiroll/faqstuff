Question:
What would be two choices for a mic that would be suitable to use to amplify live classical guitar? My main concern is to reduce feedback howl.


Answer:

	1. Gain before feedback involves the entire sound system, not just the mic.
	
	2. Recommended models: KSM137; SM81; PGA81. All are condenser mics with a flat frequency response.
	
	3. Also use a shock mount holder like the A53M.
	
	4. Search our FAQ to read about miking a classical guitar
