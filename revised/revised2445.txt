Question:
When using this combination, is it wise to increase the tracking weight to three or four grams, or will this effect the cartridge's performance?

Answer:

	The N78S is designed to track from 1.5 grams to 3 grams. Experiment in this range. A heavier tracking weight can cause the stylus bearing to collapse.
	
	The tracking weight has no effect on the M97xE cartridge body.
