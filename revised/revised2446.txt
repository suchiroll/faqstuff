Question:
I have a lot of LPs and 45 rpm records which I haven't played in years. I want to transfer some of these to CD-R discs, and I need to get a new turntable and cartridge. If I got a high quality cartridge, like the V15, would it be optimal for the 45 rpm records also, or should I get a different cartridge? It seems to me that the 45 rpm grooves are wider than the LP grooves, and should have at least a different stylus than the LPs. Thanks for your help.



Answer:

	A 45 RPM record is considered a microgroove recording, just like a standard 33 1/3 RPM LP. The recommended stylus radius is 0.0007 inch (0.7 mils) or less.

	
	The V15VxMR should do well, provided that your 45 RPM records are in good shape. If not, try a Shure cartridge with a spherical stylus (0.7 mils radius).
	
	Sorry, there is not a spherical stylus made for the V15VxMR that is appropriate for 45 RPM records.
