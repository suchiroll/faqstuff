Question:
I just wanted some clarification on what it means for replacement styli to come on a card? I mean the value seems tremendously better, 12 stylus as opposed to one with a user guide.



Answer:

	Yes, you are correct. The outer packaging and the User Guide is the only difference. Styli on the cart are typically purchased by DJs that need a large supply.
