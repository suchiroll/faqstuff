Question:
What is predictive diversity? Is it different from true diversity or Marcad diversity?


Answer:

	Predictive Diversity is two antennas connected to a single receiver section. A microprocessor monitors the slope of the RF level to predict when a dropout will occur at an individual antenna. The microprocessor switches antennas before the dropout occurs.
	
	MARCAD is explained at: Selection and Operation of Wireless Microphone Systems
	
	Both MARCAD and Predictive Diversity are types of True Diversity systems. True Diversity is defined at the above link.
