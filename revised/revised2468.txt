Title: V15VxMR suitability for Mission 774 Arm

Question:
Hope you don't mind me asking this question - I believe it's an important issue with such a light arm and, I think my ADC ZLM is near due for replacement.


This arm has a quoted effective mass of 5.5g and the handbook indicates that it *should* suit cartridges of mass 2 - 10g and compliance 8 - 50 cm/dyne. Given the lightness of this arm, is it possible that the fundamental resonance of the arm and cartridge together would make this a bad pairing?


Answer:

	Other customers have used the V15VxMR with the Mission 774 arm, and we have heard no complaints. But Shure has not tested this combination.
	
	We believe it will work just fine.
