Question:
What are the physical dimensions of the V15vxmr cartridge? I have a Merrill Heirloom table with a peripheral clamping ring. If the cartridge is too wide, it will hit the peripheral clamping ring on the first track. Can the stablizer brush be removed, without any detrimental effects?



Answer:

	Total length including the terminal pins: 30 mm
	Total height including stylus: 17 mm
	Total width: 18 mm
	
	The stabilizer brush cannot be removed. It can be locked in the up, unused position.
