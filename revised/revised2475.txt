Question:
My Beta 87 works will some cables and not others. The cables are not bad, because when I plug a SM58 in, it works.


Answer:

	The Beta 87 requires phantom power to operate; the SM58 does not. Make certain the mixer input for the Beta 87 is providing phantom power.
	
	The Beta 87 must be used only with an XLR to XLR cable.
	
	The Beta 87 cannot be used with any sort of in-line transformer.
	
	Perhaps the cables that do not work are wired unbalanced; this is where pin 2 or pin 3 is also tied to pin 1. Unbalanced cables will not work with the Beta 87.
