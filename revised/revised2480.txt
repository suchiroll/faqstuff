Question:
I have just come into possession of two old Shure mikes in new unused condition. They are hand-held, push-to-talk communications mikes. They have the model number, MK-0009 on them. The controlled reluctance element has the number 99C86 HA.


Can you tell me what these are? Specifically, I need to know if these are high impedance or low impedance.


Answer:

	MK-0009 is not a standard Shure model number. It is an OEM model number; a mic that Shure made for another manufacturer. Once an OEM model is discontinued, all records of the model are sent to the OEM purchaser.
	
	The only information we have: The MK-0009 was based on the Shure model 404B. It was low impedance. It was made for R.F. Communications Inc.
