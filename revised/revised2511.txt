Question:
I'd like to find out some information about a mic I found. It sounds pretty decent. It's labeled:


Sure Brothers Incorporated

Model PE505SP

Super Pro(TM)

Dynamic

Made in USA

Patented


It looks pretty much like an SM58. Do you have any spec sheets on it?


Answer:

	You can download the manual from the User Guide area of the Shure website.
