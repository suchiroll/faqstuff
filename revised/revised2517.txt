Question:
I would like to know if your existing desktop microphone base model A412B is phantom powered. If it is, can i use this to a gooseneck microphone with a phantom power circuit in it?

In addition, if i can use my gooseneck mic in it, will the original output of the mic stays the same? how about hum noise..etc.?


Answer:

	I would like to know if your existing desktop microphone base model A412B is phantom powered.
	* No. Phantom power is provide by the mixer, not the base that holds the mic. Phantom power from the mixer will pass through the A412B base to any microphone.
	
	Can i use this to a gooseneck microphone with a phantom power circuit in it?
	* Yes, you can use the base. But again, the mixer must provide the phantom power.
	
	If i can use my gooseneck mic in it, will the original output of the mic stays the same? how about hum noise..etc.?
	* The A412B is a passive device. It will not deteriorate the performance of any mic.
