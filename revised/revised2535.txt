Question:
Just wanted some info on the best placement and handling of a 315 in great condition. Actually, I found two: possible drum overheads?


Answer:

	We advise against using a ribbon mic, like the 315, for any type of high sound pressure level application, like drum miking. Ribbon mics are best used for voice and softer instruments.
