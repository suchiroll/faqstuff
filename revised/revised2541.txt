Question:
I need to buy a good inexpensive mic for a 5 string bass. I checked a musical acoustics book and according to it the low "B" rings at a frequency of 30Hz. Does this mean I need a mic with a low freq. of 30 or below?? Or if I have a mic like the SM57 with a low end of 40Hz will that work good too?


Answer:

	Miking is an art, not a science. The SM57 will pick up the low B, but whether you like the sound or not is your decision. As an alternative, consider the model Beta 27.
