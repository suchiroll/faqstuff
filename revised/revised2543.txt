Question:
Bought a 20 years old turntable DUAL 741 Q equipped with a Shure cartridge TKS 390 E. I would like to ask you for technical informations about the cartridge, so that I am able to adjust everything right (anti-skating, etc.) after balancing the tone arm.



Answer:

	TKS 390 E
	
	Tracking weight range: 0.75 to 1.5 grams
	
	Set the Anti-skate force to equal the tracking weight
	
	The stylus is a biradial shape; 0.2 x 0.7 mils.
	
	If you decide to purchase a new cartridge, we recommend the Shure M97xE.
