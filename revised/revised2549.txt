Question:
Is there such an accessory that will cut the frequency of a speaker signal to a line, mic, or aux level so that I can input it into the PSM Mixer. If so what is it and where can I get it?


This accessory would be ideal in situations when I need a vocal signal from the main board, but all I have access to is a speaker level input.
