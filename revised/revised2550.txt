Question:
I own Lectrosonics beltpacks and am interested in buying some WL184 capsules. What kind of wiring would I need to do to the WL184 in order to use it with my Lectro belt pack. The Lectro's use TA5F connectors.


Answer:

	Our records indicate the following:
	
	LECTROSONICS
	Pin 1 = ground
	Pin 2 = +5V bias
	Pin 3 = mic level audio in
	Pin 4 = 1k* resistor - jumper to pin 2 to change mic level input loading
	Pin 5 = line level in
	
	SHURE mics for wireless are as follows:
	Pin 1 = ground
	Pin 2 = +5V bias
	Pin 3 = audio out
	Pin 4 = jumper to pin 3
	
	Our advice:
	Remove the TA4F from the WL184. Replace it with a TA5F; only connect pins 1, 2, and 3.
