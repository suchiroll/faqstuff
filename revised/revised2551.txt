Question:
I am looking for a low frequency ribbon type microphone for use with my Hohner 265 bass harmonica. A friend of mine uses a Shure Model 330 Uni-Ron Ribbon microphone with his bass harmonica but I understand this microphone is no longer in production. Can you suggest an equivalent microphone that is available now?


Answer:

	Ribbon mics have certain tonal characteristics that cannot be duplicated by current microphones. Look at the KSM313 and KSM353
