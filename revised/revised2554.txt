Question:
I HAVE HAD A M110HE STYLUS FOR MANY YEARS AND I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND A GENUINE SHURE REPLACEMENT STYLUS.


I HAVE MANAGED TO BUY A N99E STYLUS. WILL THIS BE COMPATABLE WITH THE M110HE CARTRIDGE?.


DO YOU HAVE A CONTACT TELEPHONE NUMBER IN THE U.K. FOR A DISTRIBUTOR OF GENUINE SHURE CARTRIDGES AND STYLUS.?


I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS.


Answer:

	1. If the N99E fits the M110HE body, it will work. (We do not have a sample of the N99E, so we cannot check this for you.)
	
	2. The better choice is the NE97HE stylus. It is still available from Shure Parts in the U.S.
	
	3. Shure Europe should also be able to obtain the NE97HE for you:
	
	4. Also check the Shure U.K. agent:
	
	
	Update: 2/5/03
	The NE97HE is no longer available.
