Question:
I have a Shure M44E cartridge. I need a very good needle for playing Lp's and a needle for playing 78's.


Answer:

	1. LP stylus - N44G
	
	2. 78 rpm stylus - The N78S will fit IF you carefully file away 1/16 from the top of the plastic stylus grip. It will not fit without this modification AND it is the only 78 rpm stylus offered.
