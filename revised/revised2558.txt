Question:
I would like to be able to set volumes and select presets from the presenter's position as well as from a control booth.


1. What is the effect if two pots are both logically connected to the gain for the same input (the software permits this configuration)?


2. Can the preset selection switches be momentary, so that if I wire two one-to-one preset controls (for example) using parallel momentary switches, the last selection will 'win' permitting preset selection from either location?


Answer:

	The dual volume controls will not work. The P4800 will constantly jump back and forth between the two different volume settings.
	
	The preset selection using momentary switches will work fine. Note, if the P4800 has not been upgraded to v4 firmware, you must hold the momentary switch down for 1-2 seconds for the preset change to activate. If the P4800 has v4 firmware, then you only need to just touch the switch.
