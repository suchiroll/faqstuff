Question:
Can I install a new V15 stylus on my m97xe cartridge body?


Answer:

	The VN5xMR stylus will fit the M97xE body. However, this does not equal a V15VxMR. The construction of the V15V magnetic pole pieces is different than the M97xE.
	
	You might like the sound of your "hybrid" phono cartridge, but it will not be the equivalent of a V15VxMR.
