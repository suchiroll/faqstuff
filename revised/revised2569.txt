Question:
I have a sound company doing recording and sound reinforcement and have been collecting the Shure BG4.1 microphones for use. I now see that the BG4.1 is no longer listed. I want to get more BG4.1's or the closest replacement. I need the same sensitivity and frequency response to be compatible with my existing collection.


Answer:

	The PG81 is the closest current Shure product to the BG4.1.
	
	BG4.1 output level: -48dBV per Pascal
	
	PG81 output level: - 48dBV per Pascal
