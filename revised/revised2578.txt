Title: SM57 and bias power
Id: 2578
Legacy Id: 2677

Question:
I've read that dynamic mics don't like bias power. I've also read that the SM57 will "ignore" phantom power.

I know that phantom power and bias power aren't the same thing, so my question is, will the SM57 also "ignore" bias power?

If not, where can I get the required hardware to block the bias power?


Answer:

	I've read that dynamic mics don't like bias power.
	* Correct. This is because bias is provided via an unbalanced circuit.
	
	I've also read that the SM57 will "ignore" phantom power.
	* Correct.
	
	I know that phantom power and bias power aren't the same thing,
	* Correct.
	
	so my question is, will the SM57 also "ignore" bias power?
	* No, it will not ignore it.
	
	If not, where can I get the required hardware to block the bias power?
	* Blocking the bias is typically done via a capacitor. The size and position of the capacitor depends on the bias circuit. Here is a typical bias blocking circuit:
	
	Assumptions:
	SM57 pin 2 to tip of phone jack; tip also contains 5 volts of bias.
	SM57 pin 3 and pin 1 to sleeve of phone jack.
	
	To block bias:
	Place a capacitor in series with the SM57 pin 2. This will pass audio but block the DC bias.
	Value of the capacitor: 10 microfarads; rated at 16 WVDC; the negative end of the capacitor connects to the SM57.
