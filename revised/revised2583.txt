Title: Crystal Pickup for Old Webster Chicago Phonograph

Question:
We are trying to replace the cartridge and needle of a Webster-Chicago portable phonograph Model 161-1, RMA 375. My guess is that this player was built in the late 1930's to early 1940's. The cartridge is a Shure Crystal Pickup Cartridge with P89S stamped in ink across the edge. Can Shure supply us with the cartridge and needle or advise of alternate research path? The player belonged to my wife's parents and we would like to restore the unit if possible. Thank you in advance.


Answer:

	Shure has not sold crystal cartridges since the 1960s.
