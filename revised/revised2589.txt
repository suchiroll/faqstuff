Question:
I am trying to find the size of the DC plug of the DC plug on the VP3-CA reciever. Do you have a DC cord part number?


Answer:

	Radio Shack will have a plug that fit. The pin diameter is 2.5 mm. We suggest you take the VP3 to Radio Shack to make certain their part fits.
	
	Sorry, Shure does not sell a mating connector as it is commonly available.
