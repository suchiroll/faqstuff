Question:
What year was the SM58 introduced? I own a few of these and I hear they are "legendary'. When was the SM58 invented, introduced and first sold?


Answer:

	The SM58 was introduced in 1966. The first units were sold in September 1966.  The SM58 is based on the Unidyne III microphone element developed in the late 1950s by Shure engineer Ernie Seeler. This element is also used in the SM57, 565, and 545 models.
