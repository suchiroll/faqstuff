Title: VP88 M-S decoding with a software mixer/matrix

Question:
I want to use a VP88 in MS mode ( sans internal matrix) and since I'm using ProTools LE and I think I should be able to matrix this in the software. So I 'm trying to figure out how this should go.

Would this be correct:

Channel One is M output of mic.

Channel Two and Three are grouped

Channel two is S+

Channel three is S- (phase reversed in software)


WIll this work, as I push up the locked channels two and three I get increased spread.


Or does Two need to be M+S

and Three M-S


Answer:

	Input channel One is the M output of the VP88. This input must be panned to Left Output channel and the Right output channel.
	
	Input channel Two is the S output of the VP88 (in phase). This input must panned only to the Left output channel.
	
	Input channel Three is the S output of the VP88 (phase reversed). This input must panned only to the Right output channel.
	
	When inputs two and three are fully attenuated, the output is monaural only. As you add more input level from two and three, the stereo "spread" increases.
