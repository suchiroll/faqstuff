Question:
I would to power my FP33 using an external battery such as a quantum or np1 for longer run times. What are the specs?


Answer:

	The external voltage can be from 12 to 30 volts dc.
	
	The FP33 dc jack accepts either polarity from the battery.
	
	The red flashing POWER LED on the FP33 is not accurate for NP1 use. It is set up to indicate when the internal 9 volts batteries are low. Ignore this warning when using an NP1.
	
	A fully charged NP1 will run the mixer for several weeks.
