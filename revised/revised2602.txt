Question:
Originally our church had 4 x SC4 receivers, 2 x SC1/SC14 lavaliers, and 2 x SC2/58 wireless handhelds. We have lost one of the SC1/SC14s (transmitter pack and microphone)and need to replace it. I notice from your web site that the SC1 is now an obsolete product...

So my question is - do you have another transmitter pack/cardioid lavalier mike that is compatible with the SC4 receivers that we already have? Or do we have to buy the receiver as well as the transmitter pack and microphone?


Answer:

	The T1 transmitter will work with the SC4 receiver with three warnings:
	
		The T1 is only available on a handful of frequencies that the SC series was offered on. Thus, you must check frequencies first.
	
		The T1 is not retunable and will only work if the SC4 is set to its "base" frequency.
	
		The T1 does not have tone key squelch and so the Tone Key circuit must be deactivated on the SC4 receiver. This on/off switch is located on the SC4 front panel behind the door.

	If the idea above is not viable, you will need to purchase a complete new wireless system.
