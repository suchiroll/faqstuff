Title: SM57 windscreen
Id: 2606
Legacy Id: 2707

Question:
I'm trying to find out about availability of the windscreen for SM57 which has a rubber, friction-fit mounting ring, rather than the set-screw metal ring. I can't find that version on the website, and I suspect you may have discontinued it. But, if it is available, what is the part number?


Answer:

	The rubber friction version was unreliable and was discontinued.  The current version uses the setscrew and is the A2WS-BLK or A2WS-GRA.
