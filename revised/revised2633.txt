Question:
I was wondering if someone can fill me in on the differences between the SM7, SM7A, and the SM7B. What was improved and what has changed between the models?


Answer:

	SM7 - Introduced 1973 with a U.S. retail price of $256.80.

	SM7A - Humbucking coil improved; design of the mic mounting yoke also improved. Introduced 1999.

	SM7B - Larger foam windscreen added. Introduced 2001.

	

	The mic element is based on the Unidyne III design and has not changed.
