Title: RS232 Control of SCM810
Id: 2636
Legacy Id: 2738

Question:
Is there a way of remote controling the SCM810 through IR or RS232 or another? Do you make anything that can switch/mix multi-inputs to a single out?


Answer:

	The SCM810 does not have IR or RS232 control. The SCM810 does have TTL logic controls.
	
	Inline (www.inlineinc.com) makes conversion boxes (Model IN6901, IN6902) that convert RS232 to contact closures. While we have not tried their products with the SCM810, it should work.
