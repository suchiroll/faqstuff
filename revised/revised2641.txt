Question:
Are replacement transmitters still available for the SC series? I need 2 SM58 type handhelds and a body pack for my existing system.


Answer:

	Replacement transmitters are no longer available for the SC series.
	T2/58 transmitters may be used, with the following restrictions:
	
		The T2/58 is only available on a handful of frequencies that the SC series was offered on. Thus, frequencies must be checked first.
	
		The SC4 receiver must be set to the center frequency.
	
		Tone key must be turned off on the SC4 receiver.
