Question:
I'm trying to find information about this cartridge which came on a Fisher 6250. The bottom reads M97-AH the front reads N97-HE the stylus damper reads era IV. It isnt a screw mount. Is this a moving mag, is it bi-radial, what are the specs and are replacements available. You make a great product.


Answer:
