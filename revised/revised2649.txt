Question:
Is the KSM32 a true capacitor mike or an electret? Is it sealed from the factory with a built in charge or is it an externally polarized design? Does the mike have a limited life as do other electret or backplate designs?


Answer:

	The KSM32 is an electret design.
	
	The KSM44 and KSM27 are an external polarized design (true condenser).
	
	Well-designed electrets no longer have limited life spans like the original electrets from the 1970s.
