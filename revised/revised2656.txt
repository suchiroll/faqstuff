Question:
Could you please explain the mathematics behind configuring a speaker delay for a second row of speakers or under-balcony speakers?


Answer:

	A simple explanation:
	1) Sound travels about 1 foot per millisecond.
	2) Assume the main speaker cluster is 100 feet from the underbalcony seats.
	3) Sound takes 100 milliseconds to travel from the main cluster to these seats.
	4) The underbalcony loudspeakers should be delayed by about 100 milliseconds to be in phase with the main cluster sound.
