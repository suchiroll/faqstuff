Question:
What position on the low end roll-off switch should be used under what circumstances?


Answer:

	Flat position - recording of pipe organ or tympani or other very low frequency instruments
	
	Slight roll-off: most applications (where low frequency noise is not a problem)
	
	Steep roll-off: voice-overs; or situations where low frequency noise IS a problem
