Question:
I want to make a cable that feeds a stereo recording device from the FP33 mix bus, what would the wiring diagram be to wire the mix bus to a 1/8" stereo mini connector?


Answer:

	There is a commercial device that does this: contact Peter Engh - phone 612-827-7992
	
	FP 33 / FP32A Mix Bus Specifications
	Connector Outs:
	Pin 1 = left
	Pin 2 = right
	Pin 3 = ground
	
	Looking at mixer jack
	Upper left = pin 1
	Upper right = pin 3
	Lower middle = pin2
