Title: Phantom voltage for KSM mics
Id: 2671
Legacy Id: 2775

Question:
Is the 48 volt phantom at the microphone PINS OR at the voltage supply BEFORE the 6.8k current limiting resistors?


Answer:

	This voltage is measured at the mic connector. The exact same voltage must be measured from pin 2 to pin 1, AND from pin 3 to pin 1.
