Question:
I live in Canada and store PA equipment in a trailer outside.  During winter, the temperature gets well below freezing.  I am wondering if it is unwise to leave our wireless PSM 600's exposed to these very cold temperatures.  I know that our amplifiers and speakers are OK in these temps, but I am not sure about the wireless systems.  Are there tests that have been done to assure me that they should be OK in the cold or should I bring them inside during the winter months?

Answer:

	Cold weather should not affect the PSM electronics. However, subjecting any type of electronic equipment to extreme temperature changes in a brief period of time will cause expansion/contraction, and this can cause weak solder joints to fail.
	
	But the PSM earpieces should be kept indoors because condensation can affect their performance. Condensation can form if the earpiece is quickly moved from a cold environment to a warm, humid environment. The acoustical openings are so small that a tiny drop of water can clog the openings, be it condensation or sweat.
