Question:
Any problem with Windows XP and the P4800?


Answer:

	There is an incompatibility between the P4800 software and Windows XP when a user is upgrading the firmware of a P4800. Occasionally on Windows XP, the small window showing the upgrade progress will freeze. If this occurs, a user may think that the upgrade has failed. Actually, the upgrade is still underway and will finish normally.
	
	An upgrade should take less than 3.5 minutes using a serial to serial connection.
	
	Due to the chance of corrupting the firmware, a firmware update should not be performed with a USB adapter.
