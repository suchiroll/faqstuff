Title: T1 and T1G Input Impedance

Question:
I am planning to use either a T1 or T1 G bodypack with my violin pickup which is basically a piezo element (without any preamplification). What is the input impedance of the T1 and T1 G?


Answer:

	What is the input impedance of the T1 and T1G?
	* For either, 1 megohm (1,000,000 ohms).
	
	Piezo elements can have very "hot" output levels. You will likely have to adjust the input gain on the transmitter to the minimum setting.
