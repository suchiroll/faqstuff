Question:
I am borrowing what I have been told is a Shure Keen Klamp for tenor sax. Basically rubber coated HD piano wire with a mic adapted in the center of the C shape, that attaches to the bell of the sax. I was wondering if they were still available, and where I might be able to track one down.


Answer:

	Sorry, the Keen Clamp product is discontinued.
	
	A98KC-1 for soprano sax
	A98KC-2 for alto sax
	A98KC-3 for tenor sax
	A98KC-2 for baritone sax
