Title: Frequency response of Shure earphones
Id: 2725
Legacy Id: 2830

Question:
I am extremely interested in your new in-ear headphones/monitors, however, the frequency responses are not posted.Â 

Answer:

	The frequency response of ANY earpiece that seals in the ear is a direct function of the ears internal shape and the acoustic seal in the ear. This varies from person to person, and the variation is considerable.
	
	As we cannot guarantee a frequency response because of these variables, we choose not to publish a frequency response. It would not reflect the real world application of this type of earphone.
	
	Our advice: find a Shure dealer with units to audition.
