Question:
I have a V15 III and the Shure cartridge I replaced it with. I can't find any model number either on it or on/in the fancy wood box it came in. It looks completely different from the Type III; much slimmer in profile, coming to a point when the stylus is removed. The stylus has a little brush in front. How can I tell what it is?


Answer:

	Your product is the Shure Ultra 400 or 300; the only difference was the outer packaging. The Ultra line was introduced in 1984 and quickly discontinued due to the introduction of the Compact Disc.
	
	The replacement stylus is the Ultra 400S or the Ultra 300S.
	
	If you cannot find an Ultra stylus, replace the entire cartridge with the M97xE.
