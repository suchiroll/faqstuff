Question:
A neighbor has an old SoundDesign receiver. The manual says that the phono player should have a ceramic cartridge that should have an output voltage greater than 300mV. Is that type of cartridge still available? Or, will some type of magnetic cartridge work? We have tried using a magnetic cartridge and there is virtually no volume.


Answer:

	Ceramic phono cartridges are still available from: http://garage-a-records.com
	
	Magnetic cartridges cannot be substituted: insufficient output level; improper tracking weight.
