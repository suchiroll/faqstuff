Question:
I was given 2 new Shure PG58 mics as a gift.

I don't see anywhere in the booklet if this is a dynamic or condenser mic.

Am I to turn on the phantom power on my mixer for these mic?


Answer:

	1) Dynamic.
	
	2) Turn off the phantom if not needed by other mics.
	
	3) If phantom is required by other mics, the PG58 will not be affected.
