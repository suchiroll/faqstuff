Question:
I am very interested in the Wireless Intercom Systems that your company

provides, but was not sure who could answer my question best.

I thought that maybe you would be able to point me in the right direction to

help me find a solution for a project I am currently working on.


Basically I am looking for a way to provide 4 Audio Ins and 3 Audio Outs


I have found a third party sound card that will act as Intercom System

Connection Controller which will be installed in the IOS PC.


In my example, each user is tuned to a separate frequency, but all 4 inputs

are heard by all 3 users.

Furthermore, if I muted User 3, then User 1 and User 2 could have a private

conference.

Thus the users are fully configurable and the system allows matrix routing

of all signals.


For this to work, do your transmitters and receivers allow me to take their

inputs from the mics and then route them through a matrix controlled by the

Intercom System Connection Controller, and then feed back to them the

desired output if any.


Are there any obvious floors that you can see with such a system?

Any insights you could provide would be greatly appreciated.


Answer:

	We do not make wireless intercom systems. All of our wireless systems are one way communication only.
	
	We do offer wireless microphones and wireless headphones, but they are separate systems and not integrated together.
	
	We recommend that you contact a manufacturer of wireless intercoms. Many wireless intercoms will already do side channel discussions without any additional equipment.
