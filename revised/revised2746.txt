Title: Line level output to wireless bodypack input - cable fabrication

Question:
I have a customer that would like to send a balanced line level signal to the belt pack transmitter. The output of his device is 1/4" TRS.


Can this be done, and how should I wire the connectors?


I will obviously have to pad the signal to match mic level.


Answer:

	Here is a pad and the cable combined:
	
	1) 1/4 tip to 47,000 ohm resistor
	2) Other end of 47,000 ohm resistor to 150 ohm resistor AND to pin 3 of Tini-QG connector.
	3) 1/4 ring to 1/4 sleeve
	4) 1/4 sleeve to other end of 150 ohm resistor AND to pin 1 of Tini-QG connector.
	
	* Pins 2 and 4 of the Tini-QG are unused.
	
	Both resistors can be 1/4W or 1/8 W.
