Question:
We have installed a large number of MX boundary microphones. On a recent install a number of the microphones have LED's that are considerably less bright than others and the customer is complaining. Is this a problem previously experienced? What should we do?


Answer:

	The LED in the MX300 and MX400D series was changed to a brighter model in early 2002. It appears you have older and newer units.
	
	The LED can be changed in the field. Contact Shure Parts at 800-516-2525.
