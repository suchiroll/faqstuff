Title: Shure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kit
Id: 2770
Legacy Id: 2878

Question:
Could you tell me if this product is still being offered? I own a small sound company and we've done a few press conferences, including a couple for White House Communications Agency. This means we've got to present a quality image, which means I contact Shure. There's a reason that I own over 30 Shure mics.


Answer:

	The SM57 VIP Kit consists of:
	
	1 - VIP55SM dual shock mount
	1 - A26M vertical dual mount
	2 - SM57-LC mics
	2 - C25F mic cables with XLR connectors or equivalents
	2 - A26X extension tubes
	2 - A2WS windscreens - available in black or gray
	2 - A81WS windscreens
	1 - A13HDB black flange
	The individual components may be purchased as required from Shure dealers.  
	Also, Shure Parts assembles and sells the entire SM57 VIP Kit. Call 800-516-2525.
