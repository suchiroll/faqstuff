Question:
I have a V15 HR-P cartridge (Technics) that needs a replacement stylus. Looks like the replacment listed as VNHR-P was discontinued. If I can't get a stylus replacement, what cartridge replacement can I use? What type of cartridge is this?

	The M92E is a replacement cartridge: moving magnet, P-mount.
