Question:
I have two Shure AXS-1 mics. The problem I'm having is they have on/off switches, and I want to lock the switches ON. I've seen other Shure mics that have had a metal switch locking plate attached. Do you make something like that for this mic? 2) Is there any other way to lock the mic ON?


Answer:

	Here is a very simple idea. Place the switch in the ON position. From a plastic milk carton, cut a small square of plastic to act as a wedge behind the switch button. This wedge will stop the slide switch from being moved back into the OFF position.
