Question:
How does a foam windscreen work?


Answer:

	The microscopic cells in the foam are open, not closed; i.e., air molecules must follow a winding path from the outer surface of the windscreen to the inner. Like a car travelling around a road with many curves, the air molecules have to slow down. This reduction in speed reduces the noise produced by the wind blasts.
