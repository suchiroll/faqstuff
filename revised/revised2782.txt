Id: 2782

Question:
The SM58 spec sheet lists several model numbers. I can find nothing which tells me what distinguishes a -LC from a -CN or why I would care which one to get. Can you point me to the relevant information?


Answer:

	LC = less cable...no cable is provided
	
	CN = connector...a cable is provided with XLR connectors at both ends
