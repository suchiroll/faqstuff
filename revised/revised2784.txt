Question:
What is the maximum input level for the A15AS?


Answer:

	The resistors in the A15 series are 1/8 watt. Here is a conservative estimate:
	
	A15AS - maximum input signal level, peak to peak: 5 volts (+14dBV)
	
	The A15ASwill not handle the output of a power amplifier because of the high current.
