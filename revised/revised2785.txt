Question:
What is the maximum input signal level for the A15LA?


Answer:

	The resistors in the A15 series are 1/8 watt. Here are is a conservative estimate:
	
	A15LA - maximium line level peak to peak audio signal: 50 volts (+34dBV)
	
	It cannot handle the output of a power amplifier because of the high current.
