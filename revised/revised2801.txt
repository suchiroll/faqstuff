Title: Stabilizing a rotating choir microphone
Id: 2801

Question:
I have three older hanging choir mics that after years still tend to wander in their horizontal angle due to the rotation of the mic cable. Do you have a suggestion on how to minimize that rotation and keep them aimed in a stable direction?


Answer:

	The solution used by symphony orchestras is to use a guy wire of clear monofiliment fishing line. If the mic tends to drift to the east, add a guy wire that connects to the mic from the west.
	
	Symphony orchestras always use guy wires as the mic will drift due to cable rotation, and due to HVAC air currents.
