Question:
I have a U1L with a Lemo conector, I bought the WA302 cable for my guitar but realized it was the wrong conector. Is there any kind of adaptor I can buy to make the WA302 work with the lemo conector? Could send me a wiring diagram for the Lemo and the TA4F?


Answer:

	Is there any kind of adaptor I can buy to make the WA302 work with the lemo conector?
	
	* Sorry, there is not. Have a technician replace the TA4F connector with the proper Lemo. Beware! The Lemo connector itself will cost $40 to $50.
	
	The TA4F is wired:
	1/4" tip to TA4F pin 3 (audio)
	1/4" sleeve to TA4F pin 1 (ground)
	
	The mating connector for the Lemo on Shure UHF transmitters is FFA.OS.304.CLAC42. Check the Lemo web site for photos: www.lemo.ch
	1/4" tip to Lemo pin 1 (audio)
	1/4" sleeve to Lemo pin 4 (ground)
