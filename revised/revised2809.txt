Question:
I would like to now how to permanently modify the switching Link in jack, so that the switching function is bypassed.


Answer:

	Look at the FP16A schematic in the User Guide. Note the Link In jack has a switching contact at the jack's tip. Solder a jumper between the jack tip lug and the switching contact lug. This bypasses the switching contact.
