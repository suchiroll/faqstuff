Question:
I just inherited a really nice technics turntable (sl-d202). It had your cartridge TM2E on the tone arm. I think the cartridge is OK, but the needle itself is worn. What is the recommended upgrade for this needle, or do i have to get both the needle and cartridge?

What is the recommendation?


Answer:

	The N75ED Type 2 stylus will fit the TM2E body.
