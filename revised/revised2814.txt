Question:
What can be done to reduce the noise made by the flexible parts of a gooseneck microphone as it is positioned? Is there some sort of lubricant (graphite?) that is recommended?


Answer:

	Try a silicone lubricant. Spray it on a rag and wipe the rag over the gooseneck.
	
	Note: too much lubricant will reduce the metal to metal friction that makes a gooseneck rigid, so use any lubricant sparingly.
