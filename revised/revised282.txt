Question:
I have an old Shure microphone model 588SB and I'm in need of a replacement cable. Could you provide me with a current part number for this cable?


Answer:

	The 588SB has an XLR connector on it. The cable model depends on what the 588SB connects into. If the microphone plugs into another XLR jack, use the C25J cable.
