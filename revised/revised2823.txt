Question:
I'd like to know if there's a stylus for 78s available for the M44-7.


Answer:

	The N78S (78 rpm) stylus will work, BUT the plastic stylus grip must be carefully shaved down using a Dremel drill so that the stylus will insert completely into the M44-7 body. Approximately 1/16" of plastic must be removed.
