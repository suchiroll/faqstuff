Question:
How can I connect my power amp output to a PSM transmitter input?


Answer:

	Although not the ideal way to hook up a PSM transmitter, the model PM52 from Rolls (http://www.rolls.com) converts a power amp output to a headphone level output with a volume control. The headphone output will be close enough to line level to match the input of a PSM transmitter. It also has loop jacks so the signal can still be connected to a loudspeaker.
