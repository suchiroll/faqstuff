Question:
I just bought the Shure Super 55 and was wondering if there is a special kind of a clip that can go on your microphone stand to hold the mike so that you don't have to use the threading?


Answer:

	Atlas Sound offers a quick-release device for mics like the 55S. The part number is LO-2B.
