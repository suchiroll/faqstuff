Question:
What is the wiring info for connection of the WH30 to a Lectrosonics beltpack transmitter?


Answer:

	LECTROSONICS
	Pin 1 = ground
	Pin 2 = +5V bias
	Pin 3 = mic level audio in
	Pin 4 = 1kohm resistor - jumper to pin 2 to change mic level input loading
	Pin 5 = line level in
	
	Therefore:
	WH30 shield to pin 1
	WH30 red wire to pin 2
	WH30 black wire to pin 3
