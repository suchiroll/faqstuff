Question:
I have old jukebox Wurlitzer X7. I have heard that needle used on this machine is SHURE N-17CM. Is it correct?


Answer:

	Shure has not sold that stylus for over 20 years. But there are web sites that specialize in replacement parts for jukeboxes: http://www.jukeboxrepair.com/opening.htmThere are many other sites as well.
