Question:
The information says the Standard ULXS receiver only has channel scan. But the Pro series has channel and group scan. So what is group scan and why might I want this feature?


Answer:

	Group Scan: On ULXS, you manually chose the Group and the ULXS receiver scans all the Channels within that Group to see which are clear.
	
	Group/Channel Scan: On ULXP, the ULXP receiver scans all the Groups and all the Channels within the Groups to see which Group has the most clear Channels and which of these Channels are clear.
