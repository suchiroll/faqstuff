Question:
Could you tell me the difference between the Shure E5 and E5c?

Answer:

	Technically, the E5 and E5C are identical product.
	Differences: external packaging, model number, sales channel through which each is sold, and the E5C comes with an in-line volume control. The case varies also. The E5 is a soft pouch and the E5C is a round hard carrying case. It is EXACTLY the same product though.
