Question:
When connecting Chairman/Delegate units from the front panel of the power supply, what happens if you exceed the specified 15 units?


Answer:

	When you increase the number of units beyond 15, you run the risk of blowing a fuse. The increased current demand over the 12-pin busline cable will exceed the capability of the line driver circuitry. Fifteen is the safe number.
