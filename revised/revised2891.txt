Question:
Through the RS232 port, can an AMX or Crestron system obtain a control signal as to which mics are open?


Answer:

	No. The RS232 port does not link to the ConferenceOne microphones. The RS232 port on ConferenceOne C1-PS60i Power Supply only controls the audio input level, the audio input mute, the audio output level, and the audio output mute.
