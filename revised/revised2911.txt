Question:
I need to make my beta 53 and 54 work with an AT wireless?


Answer:

	For all A-T transmitters that have a four pin Hirose input connector:
	
	Shure shield (pin 1-ground) to A-T pin 1
	Shure red wire (pin 2-bias) to A-T pin 4
	Shure black wire (pin 3-audio) to A-T pin 3
	No connection to A-T pin 2. A-T recommends shorting pin 2 to pin 1 when pin 2 is not used.
