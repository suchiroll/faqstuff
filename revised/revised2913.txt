Question:
If possible, I would like some guidance on the proper electrical connections for a Shure M912ED cartridge.


I have four wires, red, white blue and green, and four connections: L, R, LG and RG. Two of the wires, the blue and white, have clear insulated sleeves around the actual metal connectors.


Answer:

	L (Left) = white
	LG (Left Ground) = blue
	R (Right) = red
	RG (Right Ground) = green
