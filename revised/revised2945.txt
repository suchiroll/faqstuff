Title: Low cost RF amplifier to boost antenna signal

Question:
I need to remote the antennas for a UT wireless system. The cable is already installed and I calculate that the signal loss in the cable will be about 18 dB because RG58 was used. I need a very low cost RF amplifier as the client has little money to spend. Is there an alternative to using a Shure UA830WB?


Answer:

	As of April 2004, Radio Shack offers a wideband "bidirectional cable TV amplifer", model 15-1195, that may work satisfactory for this application. This 75 ohm amplifier has adjustable gain, requires a local source of AC power, and uses F connectors. Though likely not as robust as RF amplifiers made for the professional audio industry, this Radio Shack RF amplifier will likely work for your basic installation.
