Question:
What is the output impedance of the 596T?


Answer:

	The output impedance of the 596T is a direct function of the input circuit of the two way radio to which it connects. Therefore, an output impedance cannot be specified.
	
	However, it can be stated that the 596T will properly drive a two-way radio mic input that has an impedance of 600 ohms or greater.
