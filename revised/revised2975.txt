Title: Upgrading cartridge of old 55S or 55SH
Id: 2975

Question:
I have an old 55S microphone that doesn't work anymore. Will the cartridge for the 55SH Series II work in my old 55S?


Answer:

	Replacement cartridge for the 55S and older 55SH
	The replacement cartridge for the 55SH Series II does not fit directly into the 55S and older 55SH model (as well as, PE55â€™s); the shock mount and other internal hardware are different. Since there is no "upgrade kit" of the parts needed to convert a 55S/55SH into a 55SH Series II, parts must be ordered individually, as follows:

	Installation
	
		Open the 55S/55SH and remove all internal electrical components (i.e., transformer, cartridge, and mounting apparatus), keeping switch leads intact.

		Pass leads through the 31C1561 Spacer.
	
		Solder according to the wiring diagram on the 55SH series II data sheet.
	
		Drop cartridge and spacer into 65B1618 Housing.
	
		Fasten 65B1617 Cover to housing with 30B1336 screws.
	
		Drop cartridge and housing assembly into the microphone case back and fasten with 30F1331A.
	
		Reassemble microphone case front to case back.
