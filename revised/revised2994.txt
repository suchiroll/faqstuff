Question:
I have two KSM32 microphones, manufactured several years apart. The grill screens are different. Is this correct?


Answer:

	The KSM32 grille has changed since its introduction. Around 2002, Shure shifted to a more coarse grille (but not as coarse as the KSM27) to visually differentiate the KSM32 from a KSM44. There are no sonic differences; the change is purely cosmetic.
