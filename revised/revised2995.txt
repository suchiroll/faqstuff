Question:
I notice one side of the microphone has a 1 imprinted on the plastic, and the other side a 2. Which side should be facing my mouth when I talk (or should I talk into the side of the microphone)?


Answer:

	Speak into the flat part of the mic, that has a hole in the center AND has 3 concentric arcs molded into the plastic on both sides of that hole. These arcs represent sound waves from your mouth.
