Question:
I'm going to make an adapter to be able to attach a TA4F equipment capsule to a U1L body pack. I just want to make sure my pin outs are correct. Please advise.


Answer:

	The adapter must use a TA4M to mate with the TA4F.
	
	TA4M pin 1 to Lemo pin 4 - cable shield
	TA4M pin 2 to Lemo pin 2 - bias (red wire)
	TA4M pin 3 to Lemo pin 1 - audio (black wire)
	
	With wiring above, if mic sounds too bright, then connect Lemo pin 1 and pin 3 together.
