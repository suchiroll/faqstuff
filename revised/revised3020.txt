Question:
When did Shure discontinue the LX wireless series?


Answer:

	December 2004.
	
	Shure Service attempts to provide repair for three to five years after the discontinuation date. An unanticipated shortage of key repair components can shorten this time period.

	

	The ULX series is the suggested replacement for the LX series.
