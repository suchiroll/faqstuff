Question:
Do you have a microphone suitable for use with a cajon, preferably internally (percussion box used in flamenco)?


Answer:

	Assuming there is not much room inside, try the Beta 98. It is a small mic designed for miking drums at a very close distance.
	
	The mic requires phantom power; make certain your audio mixer has it.
