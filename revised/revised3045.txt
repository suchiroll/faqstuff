Question:
I can't seem to find how to get to the battery compartment of this microphone. Before I started to unscrew the one screw, I thought I'd better ask.


Answer:

	Do not remove the screw. The bottom portion of the mic is 4 3/4 in length. It unscrews from the top portion. The dividing point is just below the switch.
