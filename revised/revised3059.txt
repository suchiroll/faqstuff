Question:
Is it possible to modify the microphone Ducking recovery timing and the Jukebox Mute timeout? Can the sensitivity of stereo input 3 be reduced when used with a jukebox?


Answer:

	a) Decrease Microphone Ducking Recovery Time

	The following modification decreases the time that stereo channels 1, 2, and 3 are ducked when microphone ducking is enabled and activated. The default time that the stereo channels are ducked is 1 second.

	
		Install a  watt axial lead resistor at location X301, according to the following table:
		
			0.1 seconds = 100k Ohms
			0.5 seconds = 470k Ohms
	


	b) Increase Microphone Ducking Recovery Time

	The following modification increases the time that stereo channels 1, 2, and 3 are ducked when microphone ducking is enabled and activated. The default time that the stereo channels are ducked is 1 second.

	
		Remove surface mount resistor R301. See circuit board legend for the location.
	
		Install a  watt axial lead resistor at location X301, according to the following table:
		
			3 seconds = 3 megOhms
			5 seconds = 5 megOhms
	


	c) Jukebox Mute Deactivation Time Modification

	The following modification changes the time that stereo channels 1 and 2 remain ducked (muted) after the stereo 3 (juke box) channel goes silent. The default time is 30 seconds.

	
		Remove surface mount resistor R318.
	
		Insert a  watt axial lead resistor at location X302 according to the following table:
		
			10 seconds = 100k Ohms
			20 seconds = 1 megOhm
			50 seconds = 3.3 megOhms
	


	d) Decrease Jukebox Mode Input Sensitivity

	This modification prevents noisy sources from accidentally activating the Jukebox mode. It reduces the activation sensitivity by 10 dB.

	
		Replace resistor R346 with 8k Ohms or similar. Lower resistor value to decrease sensitivity. Increase resistor value to increase sensitivity. To locate R346, a PC board layout schematic is necessary. Contact Shure Applications Engineering.
