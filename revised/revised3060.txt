Question:
Can I use my Beta 98H/C mic (non-wireless model) on a wireless system?


Answer:

	1) From www.mouser.com, purchase 1 - Switchcraft TA4F connector and 1 - Switchcraft TA4M connector.
	
	2) Cut the cable that connects the mic to the preamp. On the preamp end, leave a cable pig-tail of about 3 inches.
	
	3) Solder the Switchcraft TA4F connector to the end of the mic cable: shield to pin 1, red to pin 2, black to pin 3 and pin 4.
	
	4) Solder the Switchcraft TA4M connector to the end of the preamp cable: shield to pin 1, red to pin 2, black to pin 3 and pin 4.
	
	Now the mic can be connected to any Shure transmitter with a TA4M input, and the mic can also be connected to the preamp via the new TA4M connector.
