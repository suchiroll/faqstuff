Question:
Will the PGX transmitter and receiver remember the frequency setting if I remove the batteries or unplug the power supply?


Answer:

	Both the PGX transmitter and PGX receiver store the frequency settings in non-volatile memory. Both components should remember their frequencies indefinitely, with or without power applied.
