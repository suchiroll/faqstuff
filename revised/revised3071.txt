Question:
I was wondering if you had lavalier mics to fit the Sennheiser EW300.


Answer:

	None of our lavaliers come wired for the Sennheiser bodypack. But, if someone is handy with a soldering iron, a new connector, wired correctly can be put on any of our lavaliers. Use the following wiring:

	
		
			
				Lavalier
			
				1/8-inch connector
		
		
			
				Red wire
			
				Tip
		
		
			
				Black wire
			
				Sleeve
		
		
			
				Shield
			
				Sleeve
		
		
			
				Not Connected
			
				Ring
