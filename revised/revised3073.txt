Question:
Do you carry, or know where one can get an ear clip accessory for the E3 in-ear monitors that allows the ear bud to be held securely to the ear? I have problems with the ear buds popping out during performances, regardless of the size of the plugs used.

Answer:

	Here is a suggestion:
	
	Just above -- as in toward the drivers -- the Y-junction on any Shure stereo earphone is a clear tube (sometimes referred to as a zipper) that can be used to cinch the two cable portions together just below the base of the skull. This snug-fitting adjustment tube allows for a consistent seal and a comfortable fit, especially for active listeners and those that wear their hairstyle long.
	
	For proper use, insert earphones into ears. Wrap cable assembly behind each ear. Reach behind head and pull-up the adjustment tube to remove excess slack between the left and right cables and the skull.
