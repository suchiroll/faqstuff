Question:
I currently use an SM57 awesome mic but I get a really strong popping sound on words with "P." The sound quality I get with the SM57 is plenty good for my PA system except for the popping. I don't like foam pop filter covers as they really reduce crispness. The info on your site was great but didn't focus enough on anti-popping. Can you tell me about the anti-popping design on your other live mics? I have phantom power available, but, of course, I would love to buy the least expensive model that would serve my needs.

Answer:

	Here is a simple, no-cost way to eliminate popping. Place the mic at the corner of your mouth and not in the middle of your mouth right under your nose.

	Popping cannot be solved electronically. Phantom power has no effect on popping.

	Popping is lessened by re-positioning the mic or by using a foam pop screen. As you do not wish to use a foam pop screen, the remaining option is to reposition the mic.
