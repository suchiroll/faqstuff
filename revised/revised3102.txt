Question:
What is the internal wiring options for the BG 1.0 microphone?


Answer:

	The BG 1.0 microphone is shipped wired for low impedance. It may be changed to high impedance by removing the 3-pin XLR plug. The slotted screw is a left-hand thread and will descend into the plug housing.
	
	1. Turn the screw clockwise until it stops.
	2. Gently remove the 3-pin plug being careful not to break the attached wires.
	3. Remove the white block connector from pin 3 and rotate it 180? then reconnect it to pin 3.
	4. Reinsert the plug and secure the screw.
	
	
	BG 1.0 wiring
	a) There are two leads from the cartridge, green (coded terminal) and yellow.
	b) The cartridge leads go to a dual-pole single-throw switch which shorts the cartridge when in the off position.
	c) The leads then go to primary side of the output transformer.
	d) The secondary side of the transformer has three leads.
	e) Yellow is soldered to pin 2 of the XLR plug.
	f) Black and blue go to the terminals on the impedance block; black is low impedance and blue is high impedance.
	g) There is no wire connection on pin 1; the case is grounded through the butterfly wings portion of the plug.
