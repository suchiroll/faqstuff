Question:
I am interested in purchasing a WBH53 for laboratory (high-quality speech) use. I would like to use my own microphone pre-amp with integrated phantom power. Does Shure sell an adapter for the TA4M connector so that I can connect to my preamp (XLR connection)?


Answer:

	The WBH53 must be connected to a Shure preamp, like the RPM628, in order to be used as a wired mic.

	The RPM626 provides several vital functions:

	
		Converts the unbalanced audio signal from the mic element into a balanced signal.
	
		Converts the medium impedance signal from the mic element into a low impedance signal.
	
		Converts phantom power to +5Vdc to operate the FET in the mic element.
