Question:
What size is the Allen wrench (hex-head) used to adjust the screw on the A412MWS metal windscreen?


Answer:

	The Allen wrench is a #2 (0.035 inch).
	
	The 0.035 hex dimension is nearly identical to a metric 0.9 mm hex key or driver.Either should work. In some cases, a wrenchbe sold as a combo and labeled for both 0.035 and 0.9 mm.
	
	There are at least two manufacturers of the miniature hex drivers:
	- Wiha
	- Cooper Tools
