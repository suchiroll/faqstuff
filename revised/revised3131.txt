Question:
I have an information sheet which was included with a Shure N75 Type 2 Hyperelliptical Series stylus model N75HE-J. This states that this stylus tracks at 1-1/4 to 2-1/2 grams. Can you give the tip dimensions please and confirm that this is a genuine Shure product.



Answer:

	1.25 to 2.5 grams is the tracking force.

	Tip is 0.3 x 1.5 mils. Hyperelliptical.

	It is a genuine Shure product.
