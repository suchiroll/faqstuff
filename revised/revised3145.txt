Question:
I don't see any information on your website about the M97OHR-P. Which replacement stylus does it take? Also, is it a P mount or regular 1/2 inch mount? What does the OHR-P stand for?


Answer:

	This extremely rare Shure model was supplied to a turntable maker to be included with the turntable. Our records do not indicate the name of the turntable maker. We have no records on what OHR-P means...except the P at the end for P-mount.
	
	The replacement stylus was the N97 LT. It was P mount; tracking was 1.25 grams; tip was hyperelliptical. Shure no longer sells the N97 LT stylus.
