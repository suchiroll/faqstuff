Question:
I own a Windows Mobile Pocket PC which has a 2.5mm 4-conductor headset jack. Will your Treo version of the I Series work with my phone, and if not, is there an adapter I can purchase?


Answer:

	The I series Treo version will work with some PPC. We are aware of a few Pocket PC phones that will work with the Treo version I series without an adapter.
