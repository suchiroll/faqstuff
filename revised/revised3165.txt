Question:
What are the differences between the discontinued E series line and EC series line (E3 and E3c for instance)?


Answer:

	Shure used to distribute the E seriesearphones to performers through professional music equipment dealers as model numbers E2, E3, E4, and E5, and to consumers through our website and through consumer electronics retailers as models E2c, E3c, E4c, and E5c.

	

	There are absolutely no differences in performance between the the two lines. The only differences are: The E2 and E2c have different User Guides and packaging.

	The E3 earphoneswere gray, while the E3c earphoneswere white; they also have different User Guides and packaging.

	The E4 earphoneswere dark gray, while the E4c earphoneswere white; they also have different User Guides and packaging and include the same accessories.

	The E5 earphones are shipped with a small velvet pouch and a molded plastic storage case; the E5c earphones are shipped with a small round zippered carrying case, an adjustable volume control, 1/4 adapter, and has a different User Guide and packaging.
