Question:
Which Shure earphones are best for use while wearing a motorcycle helmet?

Answer:

	Shure earphones significantly reduce the amount of ambient sound that you hear, but they also reduce your ability to hear whats going on around you. Shure does not recommend their use while operating a motor vehicle, or in other situations where it is important to maintain full aural awareness of approaching traffic or warning signals.
