Question:
Is the E series Gaming Edition different then the C version.



Answer:

	No. The E series gaming edition is the exact same product asthe comparable E series line except for the following two differences.
	1) The Gaming series is only colored in Black.
	2) The Gaming series features a 6 inch shorter cable than its EC series in white counterpart. (The black version E series, E2c-N, E3c-N, E4c-N is the same length and product as the G series just without the gaming art card).
	3) The E4G gaming earphones ship with rubber ear huggers. The E4cs do not.
	
	Other than those three differences, it is exactly the same as the E series earphones line and will sound exactly the same as long as you are using the same type and size sleeve and have the correct seal in your ear. Bass response is directly influenced by the type of seal you have in your ear canal. Please try all the sleeves contained with the earphones to find the one that fits your ear the best.
