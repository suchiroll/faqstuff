Question:
What is the difference between the E2C,E2C-N, and the E2G.


Answer:

	Nothing other than color and packaging. the E2C, E2C-N, and E2G are essentially the same earphone internally. The E2C-N and E2G will have a 6 inch shorter cable than the E2C and other than the package they are in...it is the same product. Same exact sound. There is not more bass in the gaming series.
