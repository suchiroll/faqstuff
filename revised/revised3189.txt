Question:
I am interested in better understanding the i2c/ic3 Multi-Function Control Switch capabilities.  For example will it allow you to answer/end a phone call?  I have a LG-4600 cell phone and an iPod and was wondering what the user experience would be if I did not have ready access to the cell phone when a call came in.  For example if I had it on auto answer would the i2c/i3c automatically switch from my music to my phone?


Answer:

	No it will not ...you will need to manually switch the switch on the cable from listening to music to hearing the phone call. The I series does not have a send/end function. The switch on the dual connector versions has earphone volume, mute and the function switch between music and phone connector. The I series TREO single connector version has mic mute and volume. The Treo will switch automatically for an entering phone call.
