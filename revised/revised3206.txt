Question:
The three pin XLR plug in the base of the SM58 mic is loose and when the mic lead is disconnected, it pulls out the plug. How can I secure the plug in the mic body?


Answer:

	The XLR plug has a small set-screw in the side. The set-screw aligns with a small hole in the SM58 handle.

	1) Insert the XLR plug into the SM58 handle, aligning the set-secrew with the handle hole.
	2) Using a small screwdriver, rotate the screw clockwise to re-tighten the XLR plug.
