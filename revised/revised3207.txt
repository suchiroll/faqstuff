Question:
I bought the E3c-headphones and noticed ringing in the ears with the standard silicone tips. I use them for 2 hours a day while biking. Now I tried de universal foams and I notice no ringing and because of their flexibility they fit perfectly (also when they adjust to body heat).


Answer:

	Ringing in the ears is called Tinnitus and is the first sign or hearing loss. It is caused by excessive and continuous exposure to sound above 85 decibels. It is not caused by the earphone or sleeve but by damage in your ear. Please be aware of the volume you are listening to and you may want to get a hearing test if the ringing continues Our earphones block out the external noise (up to 37dB) so you can listen at a LOWER volume than you can with standard headphones, or earbuds. This should help prevent hearing loss as long as you are aware on the level of your player. We have found that rarely should a players volume be above half when using Shure earphones.
