Question:
Is the KSM32 rugged enough to use on a regular performance basis? Any disadvantages to using the KSM32 in clubs?


Answer:

	The KSM32 passes the same physical and environmental testing as the SM58. That is, we drop it onto hard wood floors from a distance of 6 feet, multiple times at multiple angles. The KSM32 is definitely rugged enough for the stage.
