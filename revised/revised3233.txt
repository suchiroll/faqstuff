Question:
Can I replace the damping fluid in the dynamic stabilizer bushings on my Shure phono cartridge?


Answer:

	The stabilizer bearing lubricant is a proprietary grease with special damping characteristics. It is no longer being manufactured by Shures supplier. In early 2006, Shure purchased the remaining inventory of this grease.
	
	The grease amount in the bearing and method of insertion is critical. Sorry to report that this is not a do-it-at-home repair.
