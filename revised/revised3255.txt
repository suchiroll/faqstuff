	Comparison of the UA844US to the UA845US
	
	UA844US has an external power supply that automatically adjusts for 100 to 240 Vac. UA845US has internal power supply that automatically adjusts for 100 to 240 Vac, a power switch, and AC power daisy-chain connector.
	
	UA844US has four antenna output pairs. UA845US has five antenna output pairs.
	
	UA844US can provide DC power (15Vdc)to ULXP or ULXSreceivers. UA845US cannot provide DC power to ULXP orULXSreceivers.
	
	UA844US may prove inappropriate for locations with high RF traffic and signal strength. UA845US has a more robust RF design to reduce undesirable RF overload artifacts in difficult RF environments, like New York City, Los Angeles, or Washington DC.
