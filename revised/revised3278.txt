Question:
Does Shure sell refurbished earphones through any retailers?


Answer:

	Shure does not sell refurbished products, and we do not authorize our dealers or distributors to do so. Authorized Shure dealers and distributors only receive inventory that is brand new, in sealed packaging. If a reseller offers open box, demo, refurbished, or B stock Shure products, they may not include all original accessories and may not meet original hygiene or performance standards. Such items are deemed to be used and are not covered by the original factory warranty.
