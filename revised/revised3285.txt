Question:
Are oxyride batteries a good choice for my Shure SLX wireless microphone?


Answer:

	Introduced in 2004 by Matsushita Electric of Japan, the Oxy-Nickel-Hydroxide (oxyride) battery is claimed to be 1.5 "more powerful" than a standard alkaline battery. The cost of the oxyride batteries varies greatly, but tends to be about 10% more than a standard alkaline battery.
	We tested the Panasonic "Oxyride" AA batteries in a Shure SLX1 transmitter. We got a solid 12 hours of operation with two AA oxyride batteries. This is roughly a 50% increase over the expected life of standard alkaline batteries in the SLX1.
