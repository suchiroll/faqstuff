Question:
Is there an easy way to calculate the loss of RF signal as it travels over coax cable? I think this is important when installing remote antennas for wireless mics.


Answer:

	Indeed it is important.
	
	Shure has a remote antenna tool to help determine which cables and amplifiers to use at: Wireless Mic Remote Antenna Tool
	
	Here is an online calculator for cable loss: http://www.timesmicrowave.com/calculator/

	And another: http://www.net-comber.com/cable-loss.html
