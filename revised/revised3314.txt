Question:
How long will the PTH (Push to Hear) battery last?


Answer:

	A brand name alkaline battery should last 15-20 hours of continuous use.  As most users will use it for brief conversations, it is feasible for the battery to last several months.  Note the PTH has a bi-color LED that turns from green to red when the battery voltage becomes low.
