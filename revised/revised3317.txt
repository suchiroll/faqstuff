Question:
I am interested in the purchase of the WB98H/C in the wireless configuration so I can use with my current body packs, but would also like the option to run wired on a XLR mic line if needed. What is required?


Answer:

	It is essential to use the RPM626 preamp with the WB98H/C for wired operation. The mic mixer must provide phantom power in order to operate the RPM626. The RPM626 converts the mic element signal (unbalanced and medium impedance) into a signal that is balanced and low impedance.
	
	The RPM626 has a TA4M (four pin male connector) that mates with the TA4F on the WB98H/C cable.  The RPM626 output is a three pin male XLR connector.
