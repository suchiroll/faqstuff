Title: M25C: Internal Resistance and Inductance
Id: 3372

Question:
I recently purchased a M25C for a project, and checking out the specs for moving magnet cartridge, I could not find the internal resistance and inductance for this cartridge.  I did find the recommended load of 47k ohms in parallel with 250pF. Please provide the data.

Answer:

	DC resistance of each coil: 1,550 ohms +/- 10%
	
	Inductance of each coil: 650 milliHenries +/- 15%
