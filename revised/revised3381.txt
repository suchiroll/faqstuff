Question:
I am looking for the frequency responses of Shure wireless microphone systems.  What can you provide me?

Answer:

	Shure wireless microphone system frequency responses  as printed in specification sheets and/or user guides.
	
	
	UHF-R
	40 Hz to 18 kHz +1 / -3 dB
	
	U-Series
	50 Hz to 15 kHz +/- 2dB
	
	ULX
	25 Hz to 15 kHz +/-2 dB
	
	SLX or PGX
	45 Hz to 15 kHz +/-2 dB
	
	PG
	45 Hz to 15 kHz +/-2 dB
	
	All of the above frequency responses are dependent upon the microphone elements being used, and could also vary slightly with input levels and gain settings on the transmitter.
