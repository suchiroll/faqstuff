Question:
The MX396 tri-mic has 9 conductors in it's cable. What connector is recommended to terminate this wire?


Answer:

	The MX396 is supplied without a connector.  Typically, an installer will use phoenix block-type connectors or XLR connectors on the cable.  It is OK to separate the cable wires out to three separate XLR connectors.
	Another idea is to use a DB-9 connector with a metal shell and cable strain relief.
