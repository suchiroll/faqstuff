Question:
Can I change the mic element on the MX690 wireless boundary microphone to get a different polar pattern?



Answer:

	The following instructions show how to change the microphone element in the MX690 boundary microphone. A cardioid pattern capsule (model R185B) is supplied with the MX690 as shipped from the factory. Omnidirectional (model R183B) and Supercardioid (model R184B) capsules can be installed.
	
	Step 1 - Open Cover and remove batteries.
	
	Step 2 - Remove three machine screws.
	
	Step 3 - Carefully remove transmitter electronics module.
	
	Step 4 - Remove screw holding plastic indicator lens in place.
	
	Step 5 - Remove five case screws.
	
	
	Step 6 - Separate upper and lower case halves. Using small pointed tool, slide antenna flexi-circuit board off case top mounting columns.
	
	Step 7 - Carefully swing case top away from case bottom.
	
	Step 8 - Change microphone capsule.
	
	Step 9 - Reassemble the wireless boundary microphone.
	
		After replacing the microphone capsule, reattach microphone assembly using clamp and screw.
	
		Swing top half of case onto bottom half, making sure to position the antenna flexi-circuit onto the mounting columns. Make sure the antenna flexi-circuit is completely inside the case.
	
		Re-install 5 coarse-thread screws to secure case halves.
	
		Reinstall plastic indicator lens on top of case, using one screw.
	
		Reinstall transmitter circuit board module, making sure the multi-pin connector and the antenna connection posts properly mate with the connectors on the transmitter circuit board.
	
		Reinstall three machine screws to secure the transmitter module.
	
		Reinstall two AA batteries.
	
		Close bottom cover.
