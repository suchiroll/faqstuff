Question:
In the Wireless Workbench 5 release notes you recommend searching the Help files by using Firefox. I'm using a Mac and don't have Firefox on my computer. Is there an alternative?


Answer:

	There is a roundabout way of using Safaris search utility. Here is how:

	
		Click HELP
	
		Select Shure Wireless Workbench Software Help
	
		If not on Welcome to Wireless Workbench page, select OPEN MAIN MENU
	
		Click on Index
	
		Press Apple + F to open the search window
