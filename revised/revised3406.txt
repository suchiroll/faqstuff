Question:
What frequencies should I use for the X1 band of the PSM 400?


Answer:

	The PSM 400 X1 band operates in the 944 - 952 MHz range. This range is primarily used by STL (Studio-Transmitter Link) transmissions between a radio station studio and the radio stations transmitting antenna.

	

	The PSM 400 X1 band has 3 compatible sets of frequencies.

	Set1: Channels 0, 1, 2, 3 (more robust)

	Set2: Channels 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (less robust)

	Set3: Channels A, B, C, D, E, F (less robust)

	

	When using multiple PSM 400 X1 transmitters in the same location, make certain they are all within one of the above sets.

	

	To assist in choosing frequencies that are not being used by STL transmissions, you can use the scanning function of the P4R as described here: PSM400 - P4R Scanning Function
