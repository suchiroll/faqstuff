Question:
Can I use the Quietspot (QSHI3, QSHB3) with a 3.5mm headset phone like the iPhone or Blackberry Curve?


Answer:

	Yes, but it will require a 3.5mm 4 conductor to 2.5mm adapter. This adapter will take the Quietspot 2.5mm plug and turn it into the 3.5mm plug to fit the iPhone or any 3.5mm 4 cond. cell phone.
	The adapter  can be found at www.blackberrygadgets.com or just click Here
	iPhone or Curve users may prefer the Music Phone Adapter we offer. It turns an SE model earphone into a stereo headset with  a control button.  More information can be found Here
