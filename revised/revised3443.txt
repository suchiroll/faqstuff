Question:
We install quite a few ULX systems and would like to make our antenna location selection more objective.Is there a test piece you could recommend that would allow us to measure the signal strength at the receiver end of the coax?

	Recommend that you contact the manufacturer before purchase.This test meter certainly looks appropriate, but Shure has not tested it.
