Question:
What does the SM stand for in the SM product line, e.g. SM58?


Answer:

	SM originally meant Studio Microphone. The first SM mics, developed in the 1960s, were aimed at the TV studio market, with a non-reflective finish and no on/off switch. Rock and roll sound engineers discovered the SM58 and SM57 in the late 1960s, and made these models famous worldwide as onstage performance microphones.
