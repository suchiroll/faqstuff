Question:
Please provide technical details on the Lemo mating connector required for the UR1M-LEMO3.


Answer:

	The mating connector (used on the mic cable) for the UR1M-LEMO3 transmitter is sold by Shure as the part WA336. The WA336 consists of the LEMO connector model FVB.00.303.NLA and a LEMO cable flex relief sleeve model GMF.00.018.DN.
	
	Lemo pin 1: cable shield/ground;near key tab - at 12 oclock on solder side of connector
	Lemo pin 2: +5Vdc bias supplied through a 499 ohm resistor;at 7 oclock on solder side of connector
	Lemo pin 3: mic audio;at 5 oclock on solder side of connector; pin 3 is also connected to +5V dc bias through a 6.2k ohm resistor
	NOTE: The audio input impedance of the UR1M-Lemo 3 is between 7,000 and 8,000 ohms. This is satisfactory for a microphone, but is too low to handle a high impedance source, e.g., an electric guitar. An electric guitar typically wants to see an input impedance of 100,000 ohms or greater.
	
	The technical description of Lemo connector FVB.00.303.NLA:
	Shell style/model: FVB - Straight plug
	Keying: B - plug has male pins (UR1M-LEMO3 transmitter has female sockets)
	Housing Material: N - Brass (nickel plated) shell, collet nut, latch sleeve, and interal pieces
	Insulator: PEEK ( a semicrystalline polymerthermoplastic)
	Number of Contacts:Three pins; wires are to be soldered to the contacts; recommended wire size is AWG 28 or smaller
	Dimensions: length -20.0 mm; diameter - 9.0 mm

	The Lemo connector on the UR1M-LEMO3 transmitter is Lemo part XRB.00.303.NLN.
	
	To connect a Shure lapel mic (e.g., WL183) or headworn mic (e.g., WBH53) to the Shure WA336 Lemo 3 connector:
	- Shure black wire (audio) and Shure cable shield (ground)to Lemo pin 1
	- Shure red wire (bias)to Lemo pin 3
	NOTE: When a Shure mic is connected using a two-wire configuration, the mic output level can be up to 10 dB greater compared to the same mic wired in a three-wire configuration used for the Shure TA4F connector.
	
	To connect a Shure WL93 mic to the Shure WA336 Lemo 3 connector:
	
	1) Determine the WL93 version. Measure the resistance between the red wire and the black wire. Connect the red wire to the + lead on ohm meter; the black wire to the - lead on ohm meter.
	
	2) Measurement result = Approximately 700 to 800 ohms - older version of WL93:
	- WL93 black wire (audio) and WL93 cable shield (ground)to Lemo pin 1
	- WL93 red wire (bias)to Lemo pin 3
	
	3) Measurement result = Approximately 18.6k ohms - newer version of WL93:
	- WL93cable shield (ground) to Lemo pin 1
	- WL93 black wire (audio) and WL93 red wire (bias) to Lemo pin 3
