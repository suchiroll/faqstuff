Question:
How do I keep that foam windscreen attached to my lav mic?


Answer:

	This trick works for most foam windscreens that have lost their grip.

	

	1. Purchase self-adhering Velcro from a hardware store.

	

	2. Cut a piece of the Velcro hook material (the scratchy material, not the soft loop material) that is appropriate to the microphones size.

	

	3. Adhere the Velcro hook material to the mic housing, being careful not to cover any openings in the housing.

	

	4. Replace the foam windscreen and press it against the Velcro. The Velcro hookswill grab the tiny openings in the windscreen and hold it secure.
