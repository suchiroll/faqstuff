Question:
I have been given a Shure tonearm, model M232. I was wondering if there was any information on it still around, specifically the spindle-to pivot mounting distance of it so that I can make an arm-board for it and mount it to my current project turntable.


Answer:

	Attached is a PDF of the M232 User Guide.
