Question:
I would like to conect my PG 185 lavalier straight into the talk back input of my PA desk.

I will therefore need to transform the female mini TA4F connector into a male XLR - do you have an adapter that will do this or any suggestions?


Answer:

	Sorry, this will not work and will damage the PG185.
	
	The PG185 must be connected to an inline preamp first, then the preamp must be connected to a mic level mixer input that provides phantom power.  The inline preamp required is a Shure RK100PK.
