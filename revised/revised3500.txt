Title: RF attenuation by the human body

Question:
In talking with friends who are Broadway Engineers, they have a term for people whose body chemistry interferes with beltpacks and wireless lavs and the rf reception.Do you have any data on this or writings I could have that explain this phenomenon?


Answer:

	The human body is made up primarily of salt water.Salt water is an effective absorber of RF energy.(Submarines have to surface to send FM radio signals.)The more body fat a person has, the more RF is absorbed.Our tests show that a body pack transmitter can be 50 to 70% less effective than a handheld transmitter simply because of the antenna location being against the human body.
	
	Thus the reason most RF antennas in theatres are above the stage...closer to the actors wearing the body packs.
