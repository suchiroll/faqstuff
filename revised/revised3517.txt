Question:
I work in broadcast radio and would like to use my cell phone as my link back to the studio. I'm looking for a device that has XLR in and XLR out, but connects to my cell phone using Bluetooth. Does Shure offer such a device?


Answer:

	Sorry, Shure does not. This U.S. based company does: www.jkaudio.com
