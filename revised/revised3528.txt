Question:
I have two STM33 tri-mics that had been hardwired into a conference room.Retired several years ago, I received them with bare ends and no breakout cables.I'm interested in restoring the connectors so that they can once again be used with a ST6000 system.I'm hoping you can give me the pinouts for both the tini QG connector and the breakout XLR cable.


Answer:

	Tini TQG connector:
	
	pin 1 - shield - to pin 1 of all the XLRs
	
	pin 2 - red wire/audio from mic #2 - to pin 2 of the middle XLR
	
	pin 3 - black wire/audio from mic #1 - to pin 2 of the first XLR
	
	pin 4 - white wire/audio from mic #3 - to pin 2 of the last XLR
	
	That is all the data I could find....in a very dusty file.
