Question:
My church has an LX4 receiver with a hand held mic and would like to switch it to a lapel mic and body pack.  Is the LX1 the proper solution and what mic is do you recommend?

Answer:

	The LX1 would be the correct bodypack to get. When you order the LX1 make certain it is on the same frequency as your current receiver.
	
	The WL185 lavalier would go well with most churches, but we offer 12 different lavalier mics.
