Question:
I own four SLX systems with the SLX2 handheld transmitter. Recently, I purchased a fifth system and noticed that the SLX2 transmitter was much noiser than the four older SLX2 units. Any ideas?


Answer:

	It is feasible that a test point on the SLX2 main circuit board is touching a ground foil on a smaller circuit board, known as the head board. This same problem can also affect the PGX2 transmitter. The symptom is exactly as you described - excessive noise. Please return the noisy SLX2 to Shure Service for examination and repair.

	

	As of April 2009, Shure Engineering has implemented a fix to prevent this fault in the SLX2 and the PGX2.
