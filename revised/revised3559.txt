Question:
The User Guide for Microphone Drum Mount A56D doesn't show where to install Lock Nuts 31A1857 and 31B1770. Where do they go?


Answer:

	The lock nuts are used on the threaded portion - printed on the side of this portion is "Shure A56D".   The lock nut is used to position/lock the plastic mic holder that is threaded onto the A56D.For example, the Shure SM57 is supplied with a plastic mic holder that screws onto a mic stand or onto the A56D.
