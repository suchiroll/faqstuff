Question:
In my Mac system preferences (OSX 10.5.7), it says the selected device has no input controls. When using garage band to record voiceovers, I am not able to use the recording volume control on the software. What am I doing wrong?


Answer:

	The X2u does not have any digital input controls.  Use the analog gain control that is on the side of the X2u to adjust the gain.
