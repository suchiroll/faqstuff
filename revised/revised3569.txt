Question:
I have a medical device implanted in my skull. My physician is concerned that the permanent magnet in a earphone might interfer with the operation of the device. What is the field strength in Teslas of a Shure earphone?


Answer:

	Different Shure earphone models were measured and all had field strengths of less than one milli-Tesla with the measurement meter as close as possible to the earphone.  Therefore, the field strength will be less than one milli-Tesla at the device location.
	Please provide that information to your physician so that she can consult with the device manufacturer.
