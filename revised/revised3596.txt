Question:
I was wondering if you still made the SM57 that is set at a 90 degree turn. It's for drummers so that they don't hit the mic cable. Shure made them in the 1970s.


Answer:

	That was actually called an SM56.  Sorry, it is no longer made.  However, there is a Beta 56A, which is a right-angle version of the Beta 57A.
