Question:
I am not hearing any playback from the computer out of the X2u headphone jack.


Answer:

	Rotate the monitor blend knob into the playback position.

	
		Plug headphones into the jack on the side of the X2u.
	
		Playback a sound file from the computer
	
		Rotate the monitor blend control up toward the XLR connector until it stops.
	
		Gently turn the headphone volume up.
	
		Audio should be playing from the headphone jack on the X2u.
