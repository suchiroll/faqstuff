Question:
I need to connect the PA805SWB passive directional antenna to a UR1 body transmitter for a point to point wireless set up. The UR1 antenna has an SMA connector and the PA805 has a BNC connector. What is the solution?


Answer:

	Shure offers the UA910 adapter for this purpose; this adapter is SMA male to BNC female. Then use the Shure UA802 cable or UA806 cable (BNC to BNC) for the feed to the antenna.
	
	This adapter is also available from Mini-Circuits, Brooklyn NY, as model SM-BF50+.
