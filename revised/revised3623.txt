Title: OEM Models: DY, CA, CB, CM, CR, GR Microphones
Id: 3623

Question:
Why did Shure make DY, CA, CB, CM, CR, and GR models of standard Shure microphones?

Answer:

	A DY model (and other such models) were sold to another manufacturer that packaged the Shure microphone with its product, such as a tape recorder, a two-way radio, or a public address system. This type of manufacturer was referred to as an OEM: Original Equipment Manufacturer.
	
	DY = dynamic mic element
	CB = carbon mic element
	CA = ceramic mic element
	CM = controlled magnetic mic element
	CR = controlled reluctance mic element
	GR = gradient ribbon mic element
	
	The OEM microphones listed below had equivalent standard Shure microphones; the only difference was the model number.  OEM archival documents are not kept by Shure; these documents are kept by the company that purchased the OEM model.
	* Note: This list is not complete. Sadly, there is no complete list of every OEM model Shure has produced since 1925.
