Question:
Is there a low temperature operating limit for a dynamic microphone?


Answer:

	Shure dynamic microphones have a tested lower operating limit of minus 30 degrees Celsius (-30 C).As mostdynamic microphones do not contain active electronic components, the operating limit is likely much lower; feasibly lower than any human can endure.
