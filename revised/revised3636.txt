Question:
Will the SE115M+ volume control work with an Apple iphone 3G? I know it works with the 3GS.


Answer:

	NOTE: The SE115M+ was discontinued in February 2013. The recommended replacement is the SE215 with the CBL-M+-K accessory cable.No, it will not work. The iphone 3GS contains an electronic circuit (hardware) that communicates with a complementary electronic circuit in the SE115M+ volume control.  The 3G model does not have this hardware and thus the volume control does not operate.
