Question:
In the MCC carrying case, there are two clips that hold up to four tonearm headshells in place. Are these clips molded into the case or are the clips separate pieces?


Answer:

	According to the engineering drawing of the MCC case, the plastic clips are fastened to the MCC case using double-stick tape.  So in theory,  it is feasible to remove the clips (very, very carefully) and repositioned the clips using new double-stick tape.
