Question:
Are there upgrade ear cup pads available for the SRH440?


Answer:

	Yes.  The earcup pads for the SRH840 will fit the SRH440.  The part number for two SRH840 ear cup pads is HPAEC840. The upgrade pads will typically provide an improvement in bass response and an improvement in comfort due to the better grade of synthetic leather and more cushioning.
