Question:
The sound system in my church is loud enough, but the words spoken cannot be understood. Is a meter can measure the intelligibility of speech?


Answer:

	http://www.nti-audio.com/en/functions/speech-intelligibility-stipa.aspxAll too often a person that is using a sound system will say to the audience, "Is it loud enough?", or "Can you hear me?", instead of asking, "Can you understand the words I am saying?"
