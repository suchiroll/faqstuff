Question:
I need a device that I can use to power the ULX receiver with DC. I can use a 12 Vdc car battery but the ULX receiver needs 15 Vdc.


Answer:

	There is a product named the "Juicer".  Feed it 9 - 18 volts DC and it provides a steady 15 VDC.  It can be used for any Shure receiver that operates from an external DC supply.  The website for the Juicer is:  www.remoteaudio.com/juicer/
