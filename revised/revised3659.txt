Question:
I have an old AV S-2020 microphone and I am curious as to when these were manufactured? I know that it is probably not worth much but I would like to know more history about this microphone.


Answer:

	Your mic is in the same series as the 515 series.  The 515 series is still made and has been around since the late 1960s. One version of the S-2020 was sold to Perma-Power and was packaged with the Perma-Power lecterns that had self-contained amplification systems.
