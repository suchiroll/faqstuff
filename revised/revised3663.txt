Question:
I'd like a Super 55 in a bright blue color. Will Shure make one for me?



Answer:

	Sorry, Shure does not offered customized Super 55 microphones.
	
	The best advice for those who desire a custom color is to buy a standard satin-chromeSuper 55,take it apart, and bring the castings to an auto-body shop. We suggest sand or bead blasting first, primer second, and then using a 2-stage enamel like offered by PPG brand. A chemical etch before the primer wouldnt hurt. Powder coating is another option.
