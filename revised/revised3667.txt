Question:
I am needing to run Wireless Workbench on my MacBookPro running Windows Virtual Machine with Parallels. Normally, I would just use the Mac version of Wireless Workbench, but I am needing to use the WinRadio which only works on Windows. I am able to connect to the UHF-R receivers via Ethernet using the Mac version of WWB, but can not connect using the Windows version and Parallels.


Answer:

	In the Parallels settings, select Bridged Ethernet.
