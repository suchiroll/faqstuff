Question:
Can my SM58 (no switch) be converted to a SM58 WITH an on/off switch?


Answer:

	Sorry, it cannot be modified.
	Recommend that you add the switch via a special XLR female connector on the cable: Switchcraft part T3F
	
	a) Wire the T3F switch to short pin 2 to pin 3 when the mic is off.
	
	b) Defeat phantom power on the mixer.
