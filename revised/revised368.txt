Question:
If I have line of sight betweentransmitterand receiver, what angle should my antenna be on a diversity wireless microphone?


Answer:

	The receiver antennas should match the angle of the transmitter antenna.
	
	If the transmitter antenna angle will vary, the receiver antennas should be positioned like rabbit ears, i.e., a 90 degree angle between the antennas, and a 45 degree angle between each antenna and the floor.
