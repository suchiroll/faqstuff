Question:
Is a windscreen available for the KSM313 ribbon microphone? I will be using a pair in an outdoor application and need to minimize any wind noise.


Answer:

	Two windscreens from Shure fit the KSM313 microphone:
	
	A85WS - Black foam windscreen, smaller profile with foam approximately 1/4" thick.  
	
	49A91 - Gray foam windscreen for VP88 microphone, larger profile with foam approximately 1/2" thick.
