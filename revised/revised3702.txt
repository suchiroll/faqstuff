Question:
Does Shure sell a gooseneck with an XLR connector on the end?


Answer:

	Shure offers the models G12-CN (12 inch long gooseneck in chrome) and the G18-CN (18 inch long gooseneck in chrome) that include an integrated female 3-hole XLR connector for directly attaching a microphone.
	
	Switchcraft sells XLR adapters that can be fitted onto the standard 5/8"-27 threads of a gooseneck for custom assemblies:
	
	Switchcraft P3F Adapter - Female XLR 3-hole microphone jack for mounting on a gooseneck. Has internal 5/8"-27 threads to attach to a gooseneck with external 5/8"-27 threads. This connector is typically used at the "top end" of the gooseneck where a microphone is attached.  
	
	Switchcraft P3M Adapter - Male XLR 3-pin plug for mounting on a gooseneck. Has external 5/8"-27 threads to fit a gooseneck with internal 5/8"-27 threads.  This connector is typically used at the "bottom end" of a gooseneck and mates with a female XLR connector mounted in a desk, table, or lectern surface.
