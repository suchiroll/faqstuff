Question:
What is the difference between the KSM44A and the KSM44?


Answer:

	The KSM44A was introduced in July 2010. Here are the primary differences:

	
		The KSM44A has a lower noise floor: 3 dB less in Cardioid pattern; 4 dB less in Omni pattern; 2.5 dB less in Bidirectional pattern.
	
		The KSM44A maximum output level before clipping is 2 dB greater into a 2,500 ohm load, and 5 dB greater into a 1,000 ohm load.
	
		Depending upon the directional pattern selected, the KSM44A dynamic range is4 to 6dB better into a 2,500 ohm load, and7 to 9dB better into a1,000 ohm load.
	
		The KSM44A Cristal finish is not as dark as the KSM44 Champagne finish.
	
		The KSM44A shock mount (A44ASM)and the KSM44A stand mount (A44AM) have the lighter Cristal finish. Both mounts have the locking feature that secures the KSM44A mic to the mount.
	
		The KSM44A is supplied with an extra set of elastic bands (RK383) for the A44ASM shock mount.
	
		KSM44A frequency response and timbral quality are the the same as the KSM44.


	Like the KSM44, the KSM44A is supplied with a shock mount (A44ASM), a stand mount (A44AM), a velveteen storage pouch (A44AVB), and an aluminum carrying case (A44ASC).
