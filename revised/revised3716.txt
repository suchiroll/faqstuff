Question:
What is the SVX line of wireless microphone systems?


Answer:

	Introduced in 2010, the SVX line is an economical wireless system sold in Asia for the karaoke market.  SVX replacement parts, accessories, and repair service are offered only by Shure Asia.  Note: The SVX line is not approved for use in China.
	This product is sold only in Asia and has governmental approval for use only in Asian countries.  The SVX line of wireless products must not be used outside of Asia as operation could violate local governmental regulations.  For example, the SVX products are not approved for use in the United States.  The use of SVX wireless systems within the United States is a violation of Federal law.
