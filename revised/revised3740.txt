Question:
I have Shure earphones, but I don't know the model number. How can I identify them?

Answer:

	Some Shure earphones have the model number laser etched into the 1/8 connector. The following photos also identify the earphones. Many earphones were available in multiple colors, so look at the style and shape of the photos, rather than just color.Certain earphones that lookidenticalhad several model numbers.
