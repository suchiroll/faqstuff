Id: 375
Legacy Id: 382

Question:
A 8800A mic is offered for sale, and I am wondering how it compares with better mics, such as the SM58, Prologue 14L, etc. I own 2 Prologue 14L's and am very pleased with them.


Answer:

	The 8800A is part of our C-Series of microphones.
	
	The 14L is a small step above the 8800A. The SM58 is a very large step above the 8800A. The 8800A does not have an internal shockmount.
