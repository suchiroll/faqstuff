Id: 377
Legacy Id: 384

Question:
I have a Shure wireless microphone. How can I find out what television station matches up with the frequency that I am trying to use.


Answer:

	Wireless microphones use the same frequencies as television stations. It is therefore necessary to avoid any television stations that are active in your area. To find out which television stations are located in your area, click on the link at the bottom of this page. The chart below provides television channel versus frequency information.
