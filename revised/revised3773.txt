Question:
Shure use to sell a rugged, waterproof carrying case for wireless mics. I think that model was WA525. It is still available?


Answer:

	Sorry, it is not.  The WA525 carrying case was discontinued in September 2010.  The U.S. retail price was $256. The case was made by Pelican and cases likes the WA525 are available from Pelican:  www.pelican.com
