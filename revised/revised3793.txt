Question:
I have a pair of custom ear molds for the Shure SCL4 earphone drivers. Can I re-use the custom molds on the new Shure SE425?


Answer:

	Sorry, in almost all cases, the answer is "No." 
	
	A custom mold is fitted to your ear canal and to a specific earphone driver.  Just as your custom mold will not fit your band mate's ear canal, your custom mold will not fit a different earphone driver.
	
	The same is true if a person has custom molded earphones with interchangeable attenuation discs for hearing protection.  The "hole" in the mold for the attenuation disc will not properly fit an earphone driver.
