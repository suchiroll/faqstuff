Question:
I recently purchased a pair of A81WS windscreens. Can I just put them in a ziplock and throw them in my gear bag, or do I have to worry about them getting smashed and keep them in a more rigid container to preserve the foams shape?


Answer:

	The A81ES will become mis-shapen, over time, if "squashed."  The foam structure is open-cell and this type is more susceptible to permanent shape distortion than closed-cell foam.  
	
	Our recommendation: do not squash/smash the A81WS during storage.
