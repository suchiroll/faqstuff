Question:
What is the sonic result when a Beta 98A mic element is used with the Beta 98 housing? And the reverse: a Beta 98 element placed onto a new Beta 98A housing?


Answer:

	Beta 98A mic element used with Beta 98 housing = Lower output level and greatly increased high frequency response.

	Beta 98 element used with Beta 98A housing = Same sound as the original Beta 98. The housing doesn not change the sound of the Beta 98 element, which is essentially an MX series element.
