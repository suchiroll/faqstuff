Question:
What was the TTR-102 test record?


Answer:

	Created in the 1960s, the TTR-102 was designed to test output level and channel crosstalk. Both sides of the 33 1/3 RPM LP record were the same. It was not a consumer test record.
	
	Sine wave signals were recorded at 1kHz and at 10 kHz with a 5cm/second peak velocity. A sine wave sweep was also recorded with a 5cm/second peak velocity. There were threesine wave tests bands for the left channel, and three for the right channel. There were also seven bands of an intermodulated signal: a 400 Hz tone combined with a 4,000 Hz tone that was 12 dB down in level. The peak velocity changed for each band: 27.1cm/second; 22.6cm/second; 17.9cm/second; 14.3cm/second; 11.3cm/second; 8.7cm/second; 6.9cm/second.
	
	Sorry, the TTR-102is no longer available.
