Question:
I recently found a Shure LP that looks like it was made in the 1960s. The front cover reads: "Shure Limited Edition, The Orchestra, The Instruments." What can you tell me about this LP?


Answer:

	This Shure commissioned LP was recorded in August 1960, with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, at the Mozartsaal Concert Hall in Vienna, Franz Bauer-Theussl conductor.  There were thirteen musical excerpts, each designed to emphasize an instrument in the orchestra or a section of the orchestra.  The record was the key element in a promotional program to demonstrate the superior performance of Shure phono cartridges and tone arms.
	
	Sorry, this LP is no longer available. The four page explanatory notes from the LP is attached below as a PDF file.
