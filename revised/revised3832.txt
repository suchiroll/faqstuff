Question:
I have a new PSM900 system. The P9T and the P9R appear to work, but I cannot get the infrared sync function to work.


Answer:

	Look closely at the front of the P9T. It is shipped with a clear, protective plastic film on the front panel. This film must be removed for the sync to operate as the infrared signal is partially blocked by the plastic film.
