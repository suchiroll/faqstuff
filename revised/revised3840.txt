Question:
Please provide guidance on using the PGX Digital frequency groups.


Answer:

	The PGX Digital is available in different frequency groups, depending upon the wireless laws in each country.  The most common frequency band is X8: 902 - 928 MHz.   This band is used for the United States, and other countries.  Band X8 is NOT used for Australia*, Brazil**, and the European Union.
	
	When using the X8 band, these guidelines must be followed:
	
	1) When using one or two PGX Digital systems, use the coordinated frequencies in Group 0, 1, or 2.
	2) When using three or four PGX Digital systems, use the coordinated frequencies in Group 3, 4, 5, or 6.
	3) When using five PGX Digital systems (the theoretical maximum), use the coordinated frequencies in Group 7, 8, or 9.
	4) Do not use different Groups as the frequencies are not coordinated between Groups; frequencies are coordinated only within a Group.
	
	NOTE: Operating five PGX Digital systems simultaneously is possible under ideal conditions.  However local RF interference and RF conditions will typically reduce this number to less than five systems.
	
	*Austrilia uses band X8A: 915 - 928 MHz
	**Brazil uses band X8B: 902 - 907.5 and 915 - 928 MHz.
