Question:
In the display of my AXT400 receiver, there is an "*" after the frequency. What does the "*" indicate?


Answer:

	The "*" indicates the frequency was manually selected on the receiver, and is not part of the compatible list from the AXT600 spectrum manager. If the spectrum manager supplies a frequency to the receiver, it will not be followed by an "*".
