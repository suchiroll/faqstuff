Question:
Does Shure make a variation of the 515SBGX mic that has a PTT (Push To Talk) switch?


Answer:

	Sorry we do not. However, a Switchcraft adapter, model P3M, may be added to the 515SBGX mic to provide a male XLR output.
	
	The P3M fastens to the 515SBGX via a 5/8-27 thread. The male XLR in the P3M must be soldered to the cable that exits from the bottom of the 515SBGX.
