Question:
I just purchased a used 545S ....the question...what is the final configuration of all those washers on the pivot bolt...I cant seem to get them just right...every combo I try, no matter how tight i make the bolt, they loosen immediately once you pivot it...love this mic...I am a harp player...I can't find it in the data sheets...no info...maybe you have a better schematic or cut sheet of the break down on these that I could follow. Thanks and love all your classic mics.


Answer:

	The 545S was discontinued in 1978.The remaining documentation is the User Guide.

	An old 545S drawing indicates the following order:
	
	Bolt
	Flat washer - brass
	Flat washer - nylon
	Spring washer (wavy or bent shape)
	Flat washer - nylon
	Mic body
	Flat washer - nylon
	Lockwasher (starred - external tooth)
	Nut

	The bolt and nut tighten independently. Once getting all of the parts assembled in the right order, this is how things need to be tightened:

	1) Tighten bolt until mic swivels with desired resistance. The bolt engages with threads in the mic base.

	2) Tighten nut against mic base. This will ensure the desired resistance is retained and the bolt doesnt come loose.

	These instructions should also apply to:

	545S
	546
	566
	SM56
