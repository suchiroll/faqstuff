Question:
What is the purpose of the black plastic piece, in the P10R battery door, marked as REMOVE?


Answer:

	When using two AA cells, this piece helps to keep the two cells secure. When using a Shure SB900A rechargeable power pack, this piece is removed as the pack is slightly larger that two AA cells.
	
	The part number for this piece is 65A15224.
