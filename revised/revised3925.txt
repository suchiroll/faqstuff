Question:
What is the difference between the SRH240A and the SRH240?


Answer:

	The updated SRH240A has a re-engineered headband and ear cup construction for a broader range of motion, increased comfort, and an enhanced ergonomic fit. The audio performance is the same in both models. The SRH240A replaced the SRH240 in September 2011.
