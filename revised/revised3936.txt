Question:
I have 5 wired SM58 mics going thru a 100 ft mic snake. Does the 100 ft snake affect the performance of a wired mic?


Answer:

	It can, depending upon the capacitance of the cable. The effect of cable capacitance on microphone response is well documented, but not widely known. ThePDF article, attached below,by Jim Brown explains it.
	
	The cable specs of better manufacturers, like Belden, will list a capacitance per foot rating.
