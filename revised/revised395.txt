Question:
I need a push to talk microphone for a classroom setting. Is the MX412D/C a good choice?

Answer:

	The switch on the MX412D is completely customizable. You can make it push to talk, push to mute, or push on/push off. There are DIP switches on the preamp in the base that allow the mute switch to be customized. The MX412D/C would be a good choice for a your application.
