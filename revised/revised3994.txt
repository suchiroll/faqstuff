Question:
What Shure earphones and control accessories work with my Android phone?


Answer:

	An Android phone is like saying that one has a Windows computer  its a software standard, but the hardware can vary.
	
	Different brands of Android phones require different switch schemes for volume control, trackselection, initiate call, end call,etc. As an example,a volume up/down button that works with an HTC model might not work with a Samsung model, or the Samsung might not support remote volume control. It simply is not economically feasible for Shure to test every new Android phone or to offer a unique earphone for each Android phone model.
	
	Shure will gladly supply complete technical specifications on any Shure earphone modelor control accessory. With this information, the Android phone maker should be able to comment on compatibility.
