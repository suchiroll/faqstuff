Title: SCM810 input gain restoration
Id: 3997
Legacy Id: 4385

Question:
I read in Answer ID 3480 that older SCM810s have 13db more gain than newer ones. I need the levels on a newer unit to match those on an older unit. Is there an internal modification that can be done to increase the gain on the newer one by 13db?


Answer:

	I read in Answer ID 3480 that older SCM810s have 13db more gain than newer ones.
	* This is true ONLY when the input switch is set to MIC with PHANTOM.

	* On input #1, note that X110 is a jumper that bridges R1026 (499 ohms).Solder a 125 ohm resistor (or a close value) at X110.
	
	OR
	
	* Remove R1026 and replace with a 100 ohm resistor.
	* Repeat for the remaining 7 channels.
