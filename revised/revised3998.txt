Question:
We purchased several MX395 mics and our current installation only has 3 wire xlr connectors installed. We would like to use the MX395 mics now with the current wiring until we get new wire pulled. Is there an adapter that converts 3-pin xlr to 5-pin xlr? If not, how would we go about making a short adapter cable? Which pins to connect on the 3-pin side to the 5-pin side?


Answer:

	1) Sorry, there is not a 5 pin to 3 pin adapter.
	
	2) Adapter cable wired as follows:
	
	XLR5 pin 1 to cable shield to XLR3 pin 1
	
	XLR5 pin 2 to cable inner conductor A to XLR3 pin 3
	
	XLR5 pin 4 to cable inner conductor B to XLR3 pin 2
