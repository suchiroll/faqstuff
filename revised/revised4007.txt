Question:
I would like to know if the WA555External Grip/Switch Cover (Black) for ULX Handheld Wireless transmitters, will work for SLX Wireless Transmitters?


Answer:

	It will fit with some modification.Using a sharp knife, trim some plastic away on the WA555 bottom so it will fit over the plastic thread on the SLX2 handle.
