Question:
What is the current drain for the P9R and P9RA? Conditions are idle: no earphones connected; no audio signal present


Answer:

	Nominal idle current draw:

	P9R = 250 mA with display lit; 230 mA with display dark

	P9RA = 220 mA with display lit; 200 mA with display dark

	All of the above can vary by plus/minus 15 mA.

	For the P9R and P9RA, maximum current drain can be over 400 mA with excessively loud audio levels.
