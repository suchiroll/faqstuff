Question:
I need a fixed gain preamp that will increase the output level of my Shure dynamic mic, so that it will be similar to the output level of my condenser mic. I think 20 dB of gain will be enough.


Answer:

	Consider these products:

	

	Cloud Lifter Preamp (model CL-1)from Cloud Microphones. It operates from phantom power and provides 25 dB of fixed gain.

	

	Fethead from Triton Audio.
