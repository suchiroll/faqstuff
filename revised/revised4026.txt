Question:
An outdoor gun practice range has a Shure wireless system. The handheld transmitter is used year-round. Any ideas on how to make the resistant to rain? I realize it cannot be made water-proof.


Answer:

	1) To protect the transmitter handle and the switches, install the Shure WA555 plastic grip cover.
	
	2) To protect the mic element, install a foam windscreen, such as the Shure A58WS.
	
	3) To protect the transmitter from rolling off a table or other surface, install the Shure A1K anti-roll device.
	
	The three ideas above apply to most Shure handheld transmitters, though there are some exceptions due to dimensional differences.
