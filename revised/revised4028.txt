Question:
How are Shure earphones supposed to be worn in the ear? Does the cable point down?



Answer:

	These photos demonstrate the recommended way to wear the SE earphones.
	
	First, bend the cable near the earphone into a shape that will work as a hook to go around the top of the ear. It is best to make sure that bend is there before inserting the earphones, as it is more difficult to create the bend once the earphones are in the ear.
	
	

	

	
	
	Second,note how the earphone sits in the ear.When inserted properly, the SHURE logo can be read correctly and the cable bend will go up and over to the top of the ear. (Front to back).Once the cable hook is routed properly over the ear, the remainder of the cable may be routed down in front of the body or down the back.
