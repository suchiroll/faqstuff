Question:
I found a Shure mic, model T-50, that appears to be from the 1940s. Can you provide any information?


Answer:

	The model T-50 was a variation of the standard Shure model 100 carbon microphone. The model 100 can be seen in the Shure 1942 catalog.
	
	The T-50 was supplied with a coiled cord and a multi-pin connector that was used for Hallicrafter two-way radio equipment, commonly used by the U.S. Military in the European operations of World War II.
