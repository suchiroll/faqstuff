Question:
Might a loofah work as a windscreen for a microphone? The loofah cells are open and appear to be acoustically transparent.



Answer:

	Shure Applications Engineering investigated using a loofah as a windscreen. The tested loofah had a diameter of 3 inches and a length of 6 inches. It was used with the Shure SM81 microphone. The loofah worked well to control wind noise and P-popping.
	
	Items to note:
	1) A loofah will absorb water, so do not use a loofah windscreen in the rain or snow.
	2) A loofah can be cut or trimmed to suit different applications. However, the effectiveness of a windscreen is directly related to its diameter and size.
	3) A loofah will shed microscopic plant material. It would be wise to protect the microphone diaphragm with a layer of nylon, such as used in panty hose.
	4) The loofah surface can stained, dyed, or colored if desired. This could be useful for a school theatrical production where the budget is limited, but windscreens are needed that also match the coloring of costumes.
