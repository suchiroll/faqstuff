Question:
I am looking for a spec sheet/user guide for a model PE53 high impedance microphone. I searched through your database of user guides for discontinued products, and found lots of other PE microphones, but no PE53. Is there another number that I might find it listed under?


Answer:

	The PE53 is the same as the model 533A.
