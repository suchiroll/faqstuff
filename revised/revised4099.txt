Question:
When was the USB port removed from the UR4S+ and UR4D+receiver models?


Answer:

	This design change occurred in April 2012. One of key USB components used inthe UR4+was discontinued by the manufacturer. Shure decided not to re-design the UR4+ receiver because the USB connectivity via Wireless Work Bench 5did not operate properlyfor 64-bit versions of the Windows operating system.In addition, USB connectivity is not supported by Wirelesss Work Bench 6.
	
	
	Non-USB versions of the UR4+ receiver will have a label on the outer box stating that a USB port is not included. As an example, the label might read: UR4S+ Diversity Receiver, Single Channel, No USB.
