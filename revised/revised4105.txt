Question:
I'm trying to decide between using the Shure SB900 lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack, and disposable AA alkaline cells. Please provide a rough estimate of the break-even point between these two choices.


Answer:

	This answer was created in May 2012, and is based on these assumptions:

	
		a) Price of a single AA alkaline cell is $0.50 in the United States.
		b) Retail price of the SB900 is $118 in the United States.
		c) Cost of the charger for the SB900 is not included in the calculation.


	

	I) If 8 AA alkaline cells (4 sets of two) are used every month, the SB900 break-even point is around 28 months.

	II) If16 AA alkaline cells (8 sets of two) are used every month, the SB900 break-even point is around 14 months.

	III) If 24 AA alkaline cells (12 sets of two) are used every month, the SB900 break-even point isaround 10 months.
