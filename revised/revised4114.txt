Question:
I need to connect a Shure SM58 into a TOA amplifer. The TOAmic input has three screw terminals marked: H - C - E.Please help.


Answer:

	E = Earth = ground = SM58 XLR pin 1 = cable shield

	

	H = Hot = audio positive = SM58 XLR pin 2 = cable inner conductor A

	

	C = Common = audio negative = SM58 XLR pin 3 = cable inner conductor B
