Question:
One of my ULXD2 transmitters will consume two fresh AA cells in less than 3 hours. And I noticed that the AA cells were warm when I touched them. Any ideas?


Answer:

	The likely cause is that a battery terminal (with a spring) is shorting to the metal transmitter handle. Please return the ULXD2 to Shure Serviceto have this problem corrected.
