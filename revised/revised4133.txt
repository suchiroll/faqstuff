Question:
I have a Shure model 55S from the 1950s. The cloth inside of the grill is ripped and faded. I want to replace it. Please provide details on the cloth used by Shure.


Answer:

	Cloth (including silk, cotton, nylon, polyester,and others)has been used inside Shure microphonessince the 1930s. Cloth was, and is,chosen based on availability, price, durability, ability to handle adhesives, acoustical characteristics, and color.During World War II, because of material shortages, the color employed would vary depending upon what cloth was available. This is the reason that the cloth color was never mentioned in product literature.
	
	Documents from the Shure engineering archives provided the following details about the cloth.
	
	1944
	Cloth- Ninon or Chiffonese #101
	Colors - Black (Shure part #10A28A); White (10A28B); Azure Blue (10A28C)
	Acoustical resistance of material shall be 1 ohm (maximum) per square centimeter.
	
	1947
	Cloth- Organza cloth supplied by Vogue Fabric, Evanston Illinois. Shure engineers would visit the Vogue Fabric store with a device, a manometer,that measured acoustical resistance.
	New colors - Maroon (10A28D); Victoria Blue (10A28E)
	
	1948
	This cloth shall consist of 80 threads per square inch. The space between adjacent parallel threads must not exceed 0.011 inch.
