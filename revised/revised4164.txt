Question:
I have been told that placing a plastic straw over the flexible antenna of a bodypack transmitter can improve the RF signal transmission. Is this true?


Answer:

	It is true. The straw will extend the antenna to its full length and prevent the antenna from curling back on itself. This will improve the efficiency of the antenna.

	

	The same came be accomplished using several layers of heat shrink tubing.
