Question:
If there a battery eliminator that can be used in place of the SB900 battery? That is, I no longer want to use a battery, but instead want to power my bodypack from a wall outlet.

Answer:

	We do offer the SBC-DC battery eliminator. It can be used with the P9RA, P10R, QLXD1,ULXD1, AD1, and UR5.
