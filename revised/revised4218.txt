Question:
I recently bought a pair of SRH840's, and I was wondering if the "HPACC2 Storage Case for SRH1440 and SRH1840" will work with the 840's, since they both have cups that don't rotate flat. If the case would work with them, I will order one from my local store. Thanks for the help.


Answer:

	The HPACC2 is large enough to fit the SRH840 headphones.

	The HPACC2 is black.The shape is a rectangle with rounded corners. The case is closed by two zippers using one track.

	The lid interior has an attachedzippered bag to store the cable. The bag is 5.5 x 3 inches.

	The bottom interior has black foam with a cut-out to fit the SRH1440 or SRH1840. This foam can be removed if the HPACC2 is used with other headphone models.

	Interior dimensions of the HPACC2 (when zipped closed):

	Depth: 3.75 inches

	East to west (maximum): 9.0 inches

	North to south (maximum): 9.25 inches
