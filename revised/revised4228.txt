Question:
What is the best way to use the Shure cleaning tool to clean my earphones?


Answer:

	For any wax/debris build-up, hold the earphonewith the nozzle pointed downward.While cleaning, it is desired to have the wax fall out of the nozzle, not accumulate in the center of the nozzle.
	
	When inserting the wire loop into the nozzle, the wire loop tip should rest against the edge of the damper; the side of the loop should rest against the side wall of the nozzle.Keep the wire loop tip against the edge of the damper/filter. Scrape the loop around the side wall while pulling it outwards to removethe wax.
	
	Do not press the loop deeper into the nozzle as this might puncture the damper/filter. Such damage will allow wax/debris to get into the transducer section of the earphone. Eventually, the audio signal will diminish or stop completely. As this point, the earphones must be sent to Shure Service/Repair.
