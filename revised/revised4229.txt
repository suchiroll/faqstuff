Id: 4229
Legacy Id: 5213

Question:
Please provide specifications for the gooseneckmics used with the DIS DDS 5900.


Answer:

	GM5923: 40 cm in length (15.75)

	GM5924: 50 cm in length (19.75)

	Matte black finish.

	Red LED light ring.

	Chrome ring at the end of the three pin XLR connector.

	XLR pin1 = ground / shield / screen for cable inside the gooseneck

	XLR pin 2 = mic audio / signal / +1.6 Vdc bias for the FET impedance convertor

	XLR pin 3 = not used / no connection

	XLR chassis/can = LED light ring voltage / +5.0 Vdc maximum

	

	NOTE: The GM5923 and GM5924 microphones cannot be used with standard XLR microphone inputs that supply phantom power. Conversely, Shure MX series microphones, and their equivalents, cannot be used as substitutes for the GM5923 or GM5924.
