Question:
Is it possible to use the BRH31M connected to a computer? How would I wire up the connectors?

Answer:

	The output level of the BRH31M microphone is too low in level to connect directly to the computer. You will need to use the Shure X2u USB adapter.
	
	A male XLR and a stereo 1/8 connector will need to be soldered onto the cable. The BRH31M will need to be wired as follows:
	
	XLR Pin 1: Shield
	XLR Pin 2: Red
	XLR Pin 3: Black
	1/8 Tip: Green
	1/8 Ring: Green
	1/8 Sleeve: White
