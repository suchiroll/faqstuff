Question:
As supplied by Shure, the WA360 is Push-To-Talk. The switch button must be downward to hear audio. I want the reverse action, that is, Push-To-Mute. I can solder and am comfortable making simple modifications.


Answer:

	
		Look at the WA360 User Guide. There is a schematic for the circuit. Orient the schematic to that S1 is at the right edge. C1 is at the top edge.
	
		Label the S1 switch terminals in this manner: top row, left to right: A - B- C; bottom row, left to right: D - E - F.
	
		Unsolder the A connections and the C connections and reverse them. The original A connections are now soldered to C, and original C connections are soldered to A.
	
		Unsolder the F connections. Resolder to D.
	
		Unsolder the jumper wire between C and F. Resolder the jumper wire between A and D.
	
		Unsolder the jumper wire betweenA and E. Resolder the jumper wire betweenC and E.\
	
		F will not have a wire.


	Here is the Push-To-Mute function of the WA360 once it is modified.

	
		With the switch button UP, B is connected to C. E is connected to F. Audio passes from A to D via the jumper.
	
		With the switch button DOWN, A is connected to B; this shorts the mic audio to ground. D is connected to E; this shorts the transmitter audio input to ground.
