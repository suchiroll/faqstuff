Question:
Does Shure offer a weather resistant cover for the UA874 antenna?


Answer:

	Yes. The WA874ZP cover was introduced in the Spring 2013. It is moisture-resistant, but not moisure-proof as it has a zippered opening for the antenna. The cover is black vinyl with the Shure logo inscribed on both sides. The cover is opened and closed using two zipper pulls on one zipper track. Length of the zipper track is approximately 24 inches.

	The cover is shaped to fit the UA847 directional antenna. The maximum length is 15.5 inches. The maximum width is 14 inches.
