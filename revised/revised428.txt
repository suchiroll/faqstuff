Question:
How can I connect a 545D Shure microphone with a guitar amplifier ?
The microphone is configured for high impedance operation.

Answer:

	This requires a shielded cable (less than 25 feet long) with an XLR female on one end and a 1/4" male phone plug on the other.
	
	The cable should be wired:
	Cable shield: XLR pin 1 and XLR pin 3 to phone plug sleeve
	Cable inner conductor: XLR pin 2 to phone plug tip
