Question:
I am seeking a tone generator with a line level output that can be operated with a remote switch. The audio signal from the generator will connect into the paging system via a Shure mixer. The audible tone will be used as an alert signal.


Answer:

	Sorry, Shure does not make such a device, but Vikings Electronics does. The model is MTG-10; multi-tone generator.
