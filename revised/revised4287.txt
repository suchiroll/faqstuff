Question:
I'd like to use my GLX-D transmitter with multiple GLX-D receivers. Is this possible?


Answer:

	Sorry, the answer is No. It is not possible to link one GLX-D transmitter to multiple GLX-D receivers. The GLX-D receiver controls the operating frequency selection and operating frequency changes. The GLX-D design does not allow for multiple receivers competing for control over a single GLX-D transmitter.
