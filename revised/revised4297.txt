Question:
Do wired microphones have UL (Underwriters Laboratory) safety listings? Or any other type of safety listing?


Answer:

	No. As a wired microphone does not create a hazardous voltage and does not require a hazardous voltage to operate, a UL listing or other similar safety ratingis not required.
