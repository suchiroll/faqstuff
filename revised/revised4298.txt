Question:
When was the PGX analog wireless series discontinued?


Answer:

	May 2013. Recommend replacement is the BLX wireless series.
	
	PGX analog wireless was introduced in 2005.
	
	The final U.S. retail prices were:
	PGX1 body pack transmitter: $248
	PGX2/PG58 handheld transmitter: $223
	PGX2/SM58 handheld transmitter: $248
	PGX2/SM86 handheld transmitter: $335
	PGX2/BETA58 handheld transmitter: $335
	PGX4 receiver: $251 (external power supply was PS21 or PS20)
	
	The U.S. frequency bands were:
	H6: 524 to 542 MHz
	J6: 572 to 590 MHz
	L5: 644 to 662 MHz
	A PGX system had 90 available channels.
	Theoretical maximum number of compatible channels within one frequency band: 9
	Theoretical maximum number of compatible channels using all three frequency bands: 12
	
	If you own a PGX analog system, and need a replacement transmitter or receiver, the replacement unit must be a PGX analog product and it must have the same frequency band as the component being replaced.
	
	A PGX-D (digital) unitcannot be used as a replacementfor a PGX analog unit.
	
	Note 1:Some BLX transmitters are backwards compatible with a few PGX receivers.  Will a BLX1 or BLX2 work with a PGX4 analog receiver?
	
	Note 2: Shure Service can typically repair a product for 5 to 7 years after the product is discontinued. The exact time period depends upon the remaining inventory of repair parts.
