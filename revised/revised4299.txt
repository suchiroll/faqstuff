Question:
When was the PG wireless series discontinued?


Answer:

	The PG series of wireless systems was discontinued May 2013; the PG wireless series was introduced in 2006. Recommended upgradeis the BLX wireless series.
	
	Note: A BLX component cannot be used as a replacement for a PG component.
	
	The final U.S. retail prices for PGwere:
	PG1 body pack transmitter: $119
	PG2/PG58 handheld transmitter: $168
	PG185TQG lavalier microphone: $49
	PG30TQG headworn microphone: $49
	PG4 receiver: $206(external power supply was PS21 or PS20)
	PG88 dual receiver: $351 (external power supply was PS21 or PS20)
	
	The U.S. frequency bands were:
	H7: 536 to 548 MHz
	K7: 590 to602 MHz
	M7:662 to 674 MHz
	
	A PG system had 10 available channels.
	Theoretical maximum number of compatible channels within one frequency band: 4
	Theoretical maximum number of compatible channels using all three frequency bands: 9
	
	If you own a PG system, and need a replacement transmitter or receiver, the replacement unit must be a PG product and it must have the same frequency band as the component being replaced.
