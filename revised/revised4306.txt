Question:
What are key differences between BLX, PGX, and PG wireless?


Answer:

	RF Tuning Bandwidth
	PG = 12 MHz
	PGX = 18 MHz
	BLX = 30 MHz (originally 24 MHz)
	
	Maximum Number of Compatible Systems per RF Band
	PG= 4
	PGX = 9
	BLX = 12
	*Local RF interferencewill reduce the numbers listed above.
	
	Receiver Scanning
	PG = No
	PGX = Channel Scan only
	BLX = Enhanced Group/Channel Scan
	
	Battery Type/Life
	PG = one 9 volt battery, up to 8 hours
	PGX = two AA cells, up to 8 hours
	BLX = two AA cells, up to 14 hours
	
	Body pack Transmitter Power Button
	PG = Multi-function push button
	PGX = Multi-function push button
	BLX = Tactile on/off toggle switch
	
	Body Pack Transmitter Gain Adjustment
	PG = 3 position slide switch
	PGX = 3 position slide switch
	BLX = Potentiometer with a range of 26 dB
	
	HandheldTransmitter Interchangeable Mic Elements
	PG = Yes
	PGX = Yes
	BLX = No
	
	Detachable Antennas on Receiver
	PG = No
	PGX = No
	BLX = Only on BLX4R model
	
	Receiver Mounting
	PG = table top or optional rack tray
	PGX = table top or optional rack tray
	BLX4 = table top or optional rack tray
	BLX4R =table top or supplied rack mount kit
