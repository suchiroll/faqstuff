Question:
I'm looking to purchase a Beta 98H/C, and I have an Audio-Technica AT2110 UHF wireless system that I'd like to use. Should I purchase the WB98H/C with the Shure TA4F or the wired version? And how can I terminate it with the proper connector?



Answer:

	Get the wireless version of the Beta 98: WB98H/C
	
	Shure pin 1 to A-T pin 1
	
	Shure pin 2 to A-T pin 4
	
	Shure pin 3 to A-T pin 3

	

	

	Here is pinout information for the A-T transmitter as provided by Audio Technica:
	Pin 1 - Ground
	Pin 2 - High Z (instrument)
	Pin 3 - Low Z (mic)
	Pin 4 - Bias voltage
	**When wiring a microphone connect both Pin 1 and Pin 2 to shield.
