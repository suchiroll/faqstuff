Question:
What is Dante? How can I learn more about it?


Answer:

	Dante is a digital audio networking protocol developed by Audinate, an Australian company. A selection of Shure products incorporate Dante to provide a mechanism for distributing digital audio.
	
	Dante allows multiple channels of audio to be distributed over Cat-5e or Cat-6 cable, and Dante can co-exist on a data network. Dante utilizes off-the-shelf Ethernet components; no special hardware is required. However, Gigabit switches are strongly recommended. Shure has had success using the Cisco SG300 series of network switches.
	
	Audio between Dante-enabled devices is routed using Dante Controller software, which can be downloaded for free from the Audinate website: audinate.com
