Question:
Please recommend a managed Ethernet gigabit switch, with PoE (Power over Ethernet), that has been used successfully with the MXW product.


Answer:

	Customers have had success using Cisco SG300 and Cisco SG200 switches. The Cisco units have PoE.

	Critical Note: Proper MXW operation is obtained only when using a managed Gigabit Ethernet switch. An unmanaged switch will result in synchronization errors and the MXW mics will mute unpredictably.
