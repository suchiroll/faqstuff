Question:
Do you have any information on the PE50-SP?


Answer:

	The PE50SP is an excellent microphone. It can be internally wired for low or high impedance operation. It also has a silent on/off switch. The PE50SP was discontinued in the early 1980's. With proper care it will last for 50 years or more.
	
	The specifications are nearly the same as the later model PE86.
