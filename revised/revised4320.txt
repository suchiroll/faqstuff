Question:
Will the Axient spectrum manager communicate to Axient receivers via wi-fi and still perform all the interference avoidance functions?


Answer:

	Shuredoes not recommend a Wi-Fi link between Axient hardware components because the wireless data link is not as reliable as cable.

	However, it can be done by configuring a pair of wireless routers as repeaters as they will talk to each other.Shure network engineers tested this concept and it worked for a small-sized Axient system.But it was found that many consumer grade routers will limit multicast traffic and the Advanced Control Network (ACN) uses a substantial amount of multicast traffic.There will be dropped packets and potential lag with a Wi-Fi connection; this is not desired when setting up a mission-critical wireless such as Axient.
