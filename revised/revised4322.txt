Title: SCM820 Fan Acoustic Noise
Id: 4322
Legacy Id: 5400

Question:
The SCM820 has a cooling fan. Please provide operational details and noise measurements.


Answer:

	The SCM820 fan onlyactivates when the internal air temperature reaches 65 degrees C, or roughly 40 degrees C ambient air temperature. The fan activates at Start speed when the low temperature set-point is reached for one second before backing off to the Minimum speed. Installing the SCM820 in a well-ventilated rack will typically keep the internal temperature below 65 degrees C.
	
	Note: High fan speed will occur only at temperature extremes. Under normal operating conditions, the fan will remain idle.
