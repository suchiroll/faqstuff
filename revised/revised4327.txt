Question:
I want to connect a Shure 527B mic to the five pin XLR input of a Media Matrix system. What is the pin out?



Answer:

	XLR Pin 1 = 527B Shield (Ground)
	XLR Pin 2 = 527B White Wire (Mic +)
	XLR Pin 3 = 527B Green Wire (Mic -)
	XLR Pin 4 = 527B Red Wire (PTT Switch Positive)
	XLR Pin 5 = 527B Black Wire (PTT Switch Ground)

	* PTT = Push-To-Talk
