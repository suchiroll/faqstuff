Question:
I have misplaced the earphone cleaning tool provided with my Shure earphones. Is there some other tool I can use?


Answer:

	Some Shure customers use a miniature brush that is designed for cleaning between teeth. The product is called a Pikster: www.piksters.com
	
	The Pikster is available in different sizes. Size 0 (zero) is the smallest and the most useful for cleaning earphone nozzles and earphone sleeves.
	
	IMPORTANT: The length of the Pikster cleaning section is 10 mm. The length of the Shure tool cleaning section is 4 mm. It is strongly recommended to shorten the Pikster brush to 4 mm so it will not be inserted too far into the earphone nozzle as this could damage the earphone driver mechanism.
