Question:
Is there a Shure carrying case available for the BLX288/PG58 set?


Answer:

	Sorry, Shure does not have a carrying bag for this product. Consider a product from Gator Case which has a laptop bag that has padded sides and interior pockets; it should be able to accommodate the receiver and two microphones. The model number is GAV-LT. More information about the dimensions can be found at the Gator Case website.
	
	There are heavier duty cases that are molded plastic and formable foam pieces that can be pulled out to make a nest for the microphones and the receiver. Those are quite a bit more expensive. For those cases: www.thepelicanstore.com
