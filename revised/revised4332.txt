Question:
I am looking to touch up the paint of my shure sm 81 microphone handle. I need to get information on the color of this microphone. I am looking for a PANTONE number or a RAL NUMBER.


Answer:

	Pantone color specifications are typically intended for specifying ink color, not paint used on metal.
	
	The lab color values for the champagne paint used on the SM81 are:
	L: 65.25
	a: +0.60
	b: +7.50

	A suggestion: take the SM81 to an Ace Hardware Store and have the store color match the handle using a colorimeter. From that, they can mix a batch of their Ace brand Rust Stop paint. It is tint-able, formulated for metal substrates, and costs about $5 for a pint in 2013.
