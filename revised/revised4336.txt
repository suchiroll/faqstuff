Title: Will a BLX1 or BLX2 work with a PGX4 analog receiver?

Question:
I lost my PGX transmitter. Will the BLX transmitter work with the PGX4 analog receiver?


Answer:

	Yes, but there are nonconformities of performanceto consider before purchasing a BLX transmitter.

	
		Shure does not guarantee that a hybrid system (a BLX transmitter with a PGX4 receiver) will meet the published specifications of a pure PGX system or a pure BLX system.
	
		When a BLX1 is paired with a PGX4, the audio output signal from the receivers XLR male connector is 10 dB louder than when a PGX1 transmitter is used.
	
		When a BLX2 is paired with a PGX4, the audio output signal from the receivers XLR male connector is 6 dB louder than when a PGX2 transmitter is used.
	
		The BLX audio companding circuit does not match the PGX audio companding. Audio will be heard but there may be audible artifacts because of this mismatch. There are no adjustments that will correct a companding mismatch.
	
		The BLX transmitter does not have the infrared SYNC feature of the PGX4.


	In the United States, there are a limited number of BLX frequencies that match PGX frequencies. See the charts below.
