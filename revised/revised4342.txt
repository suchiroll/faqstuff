Question:
I am in need of a RK93S replacement pot for a 585 SAV, can you provide specifications for replacement?



Answer:

	Sorry, Shure has not had parts for the 585 SAV for nearly 30 years. The engineering drawings are no longer available so we cannot find the value of the pot.
	
	Looking at the 585 SAV User Guide, we estimate that the pot was between 25,000 ohms and 50,000 ohms, with an audio/log taper.
