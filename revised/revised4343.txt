Question:
Will the UA864US antenna operate if 12Vdc bias is not supplied?

Answer:

	The UA864 antenna will work without 12V dc bias in the 0, -10, and -20 switch positions; note that the LED gain setting indicators will not illuminate.
	
	12Vdc bias is required for the +10 dB setting.
	
	Recommended practice is to provide 12Vdc bias as this enables the UA864 LED indicators.
	
	Upon installation, set the gain to - 20. If the system works properly, leaveat this setting.Too little gain is better than too much gain.
