Question:
Can you provide me with Shure VP83F LensHopper initial settings for use with Nikon D800 DSLR? I shoot Community Theater productions and I usually only get one chance to record dress rehearsals. Can you provide suggestions for DLSR Movie settings for audio?


Answer:

	Sorry, we do not have have recommend setting for specific cameras. There are far too many camera models and far too many different audio scenarios. Recording a string quartet is very different than recording a rock concert. Recording a lecturer is very different than recording a Broadway show. Experimentation is the key.
