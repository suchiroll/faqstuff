Question:
I have a vintage Shure microphone that still works. The model number is 510S. What would this be worth?


Answer:

	As Shure does not purchase vintage mics, we do not track values.
	
	The 510S is not a rare model - there were tens of thousands manufactured and sold. Its final retail selling price in 1972 was $22.
