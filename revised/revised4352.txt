Question:
I have recently ordered an MX150B/C-TQG, and I find now that I need to use it, not with a Shure wireless system, but with a wired XLR connection. Do you sell the XLR adapter? Even better, is there a way that I can just adapt the connector to a terminal block connection. I notice that it has 4 pins. Which pins would I use, and for what? Will the microphone work when powered by Phantom Power?


Answer:

	It requires more than an adaptor; it requires an inline preamp model RK100PK. RK100PK requires phantom power to operate.
	
	MX150 accessories
	
	Purchase the RK100PK from Shure Parts: 800-516-2525.
