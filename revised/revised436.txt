Question:
I just found a 55S unidyne mic. I was wondering what application fits it the best before going on a search for the right connector cable.


Answer:

	You can download the Data Sheet for the 55S.
	
	The first few paragraphs provide typical uses for this microphone. The main application was vocal use.
	
	Connector and cabling information.
