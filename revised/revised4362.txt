Question:
I have inherited a well taking care of SEIKI turntable. I realized that there is a Shure cartridge on it, the model number of the cartridge is DS10. I just started learning about turntables so I do not have any idea if DS10 is MC or MM. I will be more than happy if you inform me about this old model.


Answer:

	
		The DS10 is a moving magnet cartridge.
	
		The replacement stylus (no longer available) was NDC-EJ.
	
		The tracking force was 1.5 to 3 grams.
	
		The Shure M95EJ was the model most similar to the DS10.
