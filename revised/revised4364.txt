Question:
The volume pot on my 520DX is loose. How can I tighten it?


Answer:

	
		Pull off the volume control knob. It is very tight and removing it will be difficult. Wearing a rubber glove may help by improving the grip.
	
		When the knob removed, note the hex nut that fastens the potentiometer.
	
		Use a nut driver or needlenose pliers to tighten the hex nut.
	
		Push the knob back onto the shaft of the potentiometer.
