Question:
When was Digital Feedback Reduction (DFR) added to the SCM820?


Answer:

	Beginning October 30, 2013, DFR functionality was included in SCM820 firmware version 1.1.X or higher. Previous versions -- 1.0.11 and earlier -- require a firmware update through the Shure Update Utility.
	
	The SCM820 DFR adds two channels of adaptive EQ filtering to improve gain before feedback in sound reinforcement systems. Features and functions include:

	
		Assignable to input channels and mix outputs
	
		Up to 16 filters per channel
	
		Up to 18 dB gain reduction per filter
	
		Automatic feedback detection and filter deployment
	
		Freeze feature locks depth and frequency of existing filters to avoid unwanted automatic changes
	
		Auto-clear on power cycle, or timeout, returns filter settings to a pre-defined state for the next event
