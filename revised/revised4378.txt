Question:
I've recently purchares the GLX-D wireless system.What is the purpose of the USB port on the receiver?



Answer:

	The USB port is only for factory servicing, firmware updates,and diagnostics. It is not intended to be used for any other reason. Also, as it is a USB receiving port, it does not have a DC voltage on it, and cannot be used to recharge another device.
