Question:
What is the maximum Ethernet CAT5 cable length from the MXW Audio Network Interface to MXW audio wireless access point?


Answer:

	The Ethernet cable maximum length from the MXW Access Point Transceiver to the MXW Audio Network Interface is the same as any Ethernet run - 100 meters or just over 300 feet. For longer runs over 150 feet, we recommend using CAT6 cable, preferably shielded.
