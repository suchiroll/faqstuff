Question:
I have seen videos of Elvis Presley and other performers in Las Vegas from the 1970s. Some are using wireless mics that appear to be Shure. What is the story?


Answer:

	Shure did not offer wireless mic systems in the 1970s. However, Shure mic elements were sold to the major manufacturers for wireless mics in the 1970s: HME, Swintek, Vega, and Edcor.
	
	Shure offered a wireless mic system in the early 1950s called the Vagabond. By 1956 it was discontinued. Shure re-entered the wireless microphone market in 1988 with the W Series.
