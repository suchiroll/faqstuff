Question:
I have custom ear molds/sleeves for my SE535s - would those work for the SE846?



Answer:

	Sorry, no. The earphone body size is different.Each earphone model body size is different because each earphone driver requires a specific size and shape of an acoustic chamber.
	
	Custom ear molds/sleeves are custom on both sides:the ear canal side and the earphone side.
