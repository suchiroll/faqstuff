Question:
I just installed the new WWB today and got this message "Wireless Workbench Can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer", I blew out my old version and now have none, can anyone offer help? I am on Macbook pro with 10.9.1 I was running a slightly older version of WWB 6 without any problems now I can't get it back either, same warning.

Answer:

	Apple Mavericks OS has a securirty feature called Gatekeeper, which attempts to prevent the operation of software that wasnt purchased through the App Store. This feature can be skirted, or turned off completely.
