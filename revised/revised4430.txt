Question:
I'm a young guy that likes to collect and use old mics (with Shure mics being my absolute favorites). I recently purchased a Shure Model 62-7719 but I cannot find any info on it. It looks almost identical to the 533SA that I purchased at the same sale. Can you provide me with any info on the 62-7719? I've attached pics of both mics. The 62-7719 in on the left in all pics. Also, any idea where I can find some replacement foam for these mics? I can see that's it's falling apart from age.


Answer:

	Your model is an OEM version of the 533 model.Sorry, no replacement parts, including foam, have been available since about 1985.
