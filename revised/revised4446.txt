Question:
I recently purchased a new GLXD16 guitar wireless system. The transmitter cable that came with it does not have any type of re-enforcing webbing around the wire. However, I have seen a photos on the internet with a cable that has webbing on the outer surface. Is this cable available from Shure?



Answer:

	Sorry, the photo is incorrect.The photo was taken before the final cable was selected.The webbing cable in the photo did not passdurability tests.
	
	Shure is attempting to find all photos with the incorrect cable and replace it with a newer photo.
