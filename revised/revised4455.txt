Question:
I read that the SM31-FH fitness headset is sweat resistant. How is this accomplished?


Answer:

	The mic cartridge is tightly wrapped in a hydrophobic (water-resistant)cloth that causes moisture to bead and wick away. It is recommended to air-dry the SM31-FH between uses. Sweat that builds up on the cloth can eventually solidify and become corrosive.
