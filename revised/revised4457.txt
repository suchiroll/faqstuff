Question:
Will the MX150 work with the BLX1 transmitter?

Answer:

	Please note that the MX150 series of lavalier microphones will operate with BLX transmitters.However, there can be unsatisfactory audio quality and/or a high level of noise.Either issue may not be a problem in certain applications where audio quality is masked by other noise: factory tour, football stadium, trade show floor, etc.
