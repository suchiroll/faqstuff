Question:
I'm interested in getting an accessory cable with iPad/ iPod buttons for my SE215 headphones. The question I have is the original cable that comes with the headphone has a stiff area that wraps around your ear. Does the 3 button cable have that feature? If it doesn't why not how will it stay firmly on your ear without the stiff ends?


Answer:

	The CBL-M+ is a detachable earphone cable that allows any of our detachable earphones to have 3 button control functionality when paired with an Apple product such as the iPhone or iPad, etc. As you mentioned, our standard earphone cable has a formable wire to help with secure earphone wearing, especially when being used on stage.All of our earphones are designed to the standards that we have found to be required for use with our PSM stage monitor systems, and this over the ear with formable wire design is one of those features.
	
	When we did our research about creating a cable for use with a mobile device, we learned that one of the desired market features was to be able to quickly install the earphone to be used with a phone call.We designed the CBL-M+ Apple control cable without the form able wire as to make inserting the earphone as easy as possible.This way, the end user can more quickly insert the earphone without having to fidget as much with the cable.
	
	The CBL-M+ cable does still have a design feature that allow it to be easily routed over the ear.For instance, the CBL-M+ cable exits the earphone with an elbow shaped flex relief that helps to keep the cable routed up and over the ear.
