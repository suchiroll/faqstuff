Question:
Can a Shure BRH headset be used as a replacement for the DIS IH6000 if the appropriate connector and pin-out were followed?

Answer:

	We tried this - it doesnt work. The IH 6000 had a much hotter, electret element. The BRH is dynamic, and the signal level is too weak to drive the IS 6132 appropriately.
