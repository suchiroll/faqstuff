Question:
Is it possible to link the MXWANI to the SCM820-D and 2 charging stations (for 8 goosenecks) and a laptop without using a router? I figure i have enough ports but not sure if it will work..

If this is possible does it make set up more complex. i.e would i have to manually assign i.p addresses?



Answer:

	Yes, it is possible. Utilize the additional Ethernet port on the SCM820D. If this is a self-contained system, you should not have to assign IP addresses.
	
	Keep in mind the MXWAPT must connect to the PoE port on the MXWANI.
