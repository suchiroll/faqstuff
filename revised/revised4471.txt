Question:
I have a single channel ULXD4. Upon power up, the receiver asks for a "password." Comments?



Answer:

	This is a sign of a defective receiver in need of repair. The firmware is likely corrupt and this cannot resolve in the field. The ULXD receiver must be sent in to Shure Service for repair/replacement.
