Question:
Please recommend a carrying case for the BLX88 dual wireless system.


Answer:

	We liked the model GAV-LT from Gator Cases. See photo below. Itwas a soft-sided, padded carrying case that could hold the receiver, the transmitters, and all the acccessories. As of December 2015, we learned it was discontinued.
	
	But note it looks much like a generic laptop carrying bag and therefore we suggest looking at such padded, zippered bags designed for computers.
