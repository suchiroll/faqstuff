Question:
How can I continuously power the MXW6 or MXW8? I have an application where I need to power the mic full time using an AC wall outlet.



Answer:

	The MXW6 and MXW8 can be powered using the USB port. The Shure SBC-USB-A power supply will work; it is powered from an AC wall outlet.Connect theSBC power supply to the MXW mic. The MXW mic usesthe Type A USB connector.
	
	TheMXW mic will now be powered from the wall outlet and will not be draining the internal battery.
