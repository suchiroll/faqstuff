Question:
Can I link ULX-D receivers and QLX-D receivers into a network and have a frequency scan that applies to all receivers?


Answer:

	No.  QLX-D receivers linked as network can do a network frequency scan; same for linked ULX-D receivers.   But a network frequency scan will not work for QLX-D receivers linked to ULX-D receivers
