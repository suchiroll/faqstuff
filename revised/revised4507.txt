Question:
How is antenna distribution handled for QLX-D?

Answer:

	It is the same as with ULX-D single receivers. Use the UA844+SWB RF distribution amplifier, UA221 RF splitter/combiner, etc. See our online Wireless Accessory Wizard.
	
	Note: Unlike the ULXD4, the QLXD4 does NOT provide 12Vdc bias on its antenna ports. Bias can be added by using the UABIAST accessory.
