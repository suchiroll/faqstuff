Question:
I want to control the QLX-D receiver with a Crestron touchscreen. What are the control strings?


Answer:

	The QLXD4 receiver can be monitored and controlled via a control system, such as AMX, Crestron, or Extron.

	Volume
	Channel Name
	Frequency
	Group/Channel 
	Battery Usage Information
	Audio & RF Meters
