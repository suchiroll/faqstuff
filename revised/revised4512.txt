Question:
What preamp is provided with the SM35XLR? I want to use my SM35-TQG as a wired mic.


Answer:

	The preamp is the RPM626; it requires phantom power to operate.
	
	The RPM626 input connector is a TA4M - the same connector used on most Shure bodypack transmitters. Thus, the cable from the mic terminates in a TA4F connector.
	
	The output connector of the RPM626 is a standard three-pin male XLR.
