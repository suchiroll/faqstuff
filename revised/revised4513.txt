Question:
When mounting two QLXD4 receivers side-by-side in a rack, how are the two units secured to each other?


Answer:

	The QLXD shipping carton contains a flat metal plate mount (part #53A22140)that fastens to the bottom of the receivers.Two plates are required. One plate is supplied with each QLXD4 receiver.
	
	The plate is stored at the rear of the shipping carton with a cardboard sleeve around it. It may not be noticed when first opening the carton.
