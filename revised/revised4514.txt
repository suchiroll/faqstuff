Question:
I have a wireless mic. How do I determine which frequency band it is in? Is that printed on the product somewhere?

Answer:

	The band information is printed on every transmitter and receiver. Depending on the model number, the band information could be on the front, the back, the bottom, or inside the battery compartment. The band will be similar to:
	
	 G50 470-534 MHz
	H8 518-542 MHz
	 J3 572-596 MHz
	 etc.
	
	Receiver
	On the receiver, look for a sticker on the back or the front.
	
	
	 
	
	Handheld
	On a handheld transmitter, look for a sticker inside the battery compartment or a label near the display.
	
	 
	
	Bodypack
	On a bodypack, look for a label on the front or for a sticker on the back near the belt clip.
