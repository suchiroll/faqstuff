Question:
What microphone did Frank Sinatra use for live performances in Las Vegas during the 1960s? He often performed with the Basie band.


Answer:

	In the 1960s, Sinatra frequently sang into the Shure model 546 with the A45 quick-disconnect isolation mount accessory.
	
	From the book Sinatra: An Intimate Portrait of a Very Good Year:
	
	Using the microphone is a Sinatra art, one he thinks other singersnever learn. A microphone is their instrument, he says, Instead of playing a saxophone, theyre playing a microphone. Frank prefers a dark mike to blend into his dinner jacket, moves around with it but subtly, and never letshis audience hear a popping p or intake of breath. I guess a bad parallel would be that its like a geisha girl uses her fan.

	When Sinatra appeared at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, he sometimesused the Shure SM33 ribbon microphone. This model was a favorite of Joe Mall, the chief audio engineer at the Sands.
	
	The Shure model 546 was Sinatras vocal mic for his famous 1966 recording of Frank Sinatra - Live at the Sands - with the Count Basie Orchestra.
	
	On June 13, 1971, Sinatra performed his Retirement Concert in Los Angeles at the Ahmanson Theater. His vocal mic was the Shure SM53. His stage monitors were Shure VA301-S loudspeakers. Later in the 1970s, the SM58 became Sinatras primarymicrophone for performances.
