Question:
I currently have M70BX cartridges. I know, it's been a while. But they still do the job so why fix it right? I'm looking for a replacement stylus. Are there any out there for this? Can I use the M35X stylus?


Answer:

	The stylus model is N70BX. Shure Parts might have a few remaining in inventory: call 800-516-2525.
	
	If not, there are many sources where you can purchase discontinued Shure styli.
	
	The N35X stylus does ft M70BX and will work OK.
