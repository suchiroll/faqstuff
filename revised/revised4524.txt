Question:
I had a question regarding QLXD. If a QLX-D unit is networked with a ULXD unit of same frequency band, can one unit scan and deploy to both?


Answer:

	No. The network scan only works on QLX-D receivers within the same band. It does not work with networked QLX-D and ULX-D even if they are in the same band.
