Id: 4527

Question:
Do the following commands turn on/off gating for channel 1 on Mix A?
AlwaysOnAInput1On
AlwaysOnAInput1Off

Are there commands to turn gating on  off for all mic channels?

Answer:

	To force a channel on, send:
	
	 SET 1 ALWAYS_ON_ENABLE_A ON 
	
	To put the channel back to automix mode, send:
	
	 SET 1 ALWAYS_ON_ENABLE_A OFF 
	
	To control all channels, send:
	
	 SET 0 ALWAYS_ON_ENABLE_A ON 
	 SET 0 ALWAYS_ON_ENABLE_A OFF 
	
	Note that this does not force a channel off. This only switches between ON and AUTOMIX. To force a channel off, use the AUDIO_MUTE command.
