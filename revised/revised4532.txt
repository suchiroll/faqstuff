Question:
I bought the PG27-USB mic which comes with a stand adapter. But the "adapter" doesn't fit a standard Desk stand. Please clarify.

Answer:

	Shure microphones and Shure micholdershave a standard 5/8-27 internal thread.This is the U.S. standard for mic stands.
	
	Most Shure micsare also provided with an metal insert/adapter for European stands that have a 3/8 thread - typically this Euro adapter is brass or silver in color.If the Euro adapter has been threaded into the 5/8 mic stand thread, the Euro adapter can be removed; it simply unscrews.
