Question:
What is the operational time (one recharge) on a MXWS8G10/C system?

Answer:

	While the rechargeable Li-Ion batteries for MXW transmitters are designed to last up to 9 hours on a charge, variance in battery health and use-case may result in significant differences in battery runtime.

	A warn battery might have a runtime of 6-7 hours. See the MXW User Guide for more information.
