Question:
We’re interested in purchasing the Shure ULX-D wireless receiver and the question I have is – Will this be compatible with EtherSound (ES100)? Your brochure only mentions compatibility with Dante systems. We are using a Yamaha M7CL- 48ES board with EtherSound ES100.

Answer:

	Sorry, the ULXD is not compatible with Ethersound. ULXD Dual and Quad receivers feature only Dante.
