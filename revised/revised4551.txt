Question:
Any idea why a phono cartridge might exhibit a low output level or poor tracking?

Answer:

	Here is one often overlooked reason: the stylus assembly is not properly seated into the phono cartridge body. If the stylus is pulled out slightly or dislodged, the result is low output and/or poor tracking. Make certain the stylus is fully inserted into the cartridge body.
