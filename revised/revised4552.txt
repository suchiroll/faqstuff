Question:
I received a RK100PK IN-LINE PREAMPLIFIER with my MX150/O Sublav microphone. Could you please give a brief overview of what it does and what situations call for it?

Answer:

	If the MX150 is to be used as a wired mic, the RK100PK must be employed.
	
	The RK100PK requires phantom power to operate.Phantom power is provided by the mic mixer.
	
	The RK100PK converts the mic element signal (unbalanced and medium impedance) into a signal that is balanced and low impedance.
