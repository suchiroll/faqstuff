Question:
I have the SM7B and i was wondering if you can switch the settings, flat response, bass roll off and presence boost while the microphone is plugged in and muted so i can check the different recording tones. Will this cause damage, or is it best to have the setting fixed before plugging in and recording?

Answer:

	It is OK to change the settings while the mic is plugged in, and/or in use.
