Question:
I would like to know if there is a difference in mic capsule between the SM31FH and the SM35. I need a mic for vocals.

Answer:

	Yes, there is a difference. Here are the primary differences:
	
	SM35 has 9 dB less output level - not critical for singing because the mic is close to the mouth.
	
	SM35 has a tighter polar pattern.This means less feedback when use for live music.
	
	SM35 has a better bass response and a better high end response.It has better fidelity for music.
	
	Bottom line:SM35 should sound better for vocals.
