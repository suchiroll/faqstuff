Question:
I have an MXW wireless system with ver 2.0.5 firmware. When I try to scan the environment, the scan data does not show up.


Answer:

	As of Oct 28, 2014, we have discovered a bug in ver 2.0.5 firmware that can cause the scan data to not show.
	
	Thankfully, there is a workaround.
	
	After starting the scanner, x-out of the pop-up (do NOT stop the scan), and re-open Spectrum Scanner.The Scanner is working, its just not initially writing to the webserver GUI in some cases.
	
	A new firmware that fixes this issue will be made available a few weeks from the above date. Use the Shure Update Utility to check for new firmware.
