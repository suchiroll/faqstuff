Question:
I have SE215 earbuds and the Earphone Accessory Cable for use my iPhone. Everything works but I can't hear myself talk through the earbuds. Is this by design?


Answer:

	Hearingones voicein the earphones, while making a call, is called sidetone.The level of sidetone is determined by the mobile phone and its related audio circuits, not by the earphones. Shure earphones do not have a circuit that provides sidetone.
	
	Echo with CBL-M+-K when using my phone
