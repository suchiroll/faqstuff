Question:
In late 2014, the battery frame in the ULXD1 was changed. Please provide details.

Answer:

	Toimprove the quality, reliability and durability of the ULXD1, Shure instituted a new battery frame design that was first employed with QLX-D.The new frame eliminates potential battery contact issues when using AA Alkaline cells.
	
	Note that the SB900 rechargeable battery does not have contact issues.
	
	To determine if a ULXD1 has the new frame, look for the label inside the battery compartment.Printed above the word Mexico, there will be the letter F (for Frame).
	
	When using AA cells with an older ULXD1 without the new frame, use the battery cradle accessory that was supplied with transmitter.
