Question:
I was given a two disc set of new stereo microgroove 78s on the Rivermont label. I have a Thorens turntable and a Shure M78S cartridge. I assume I will need a different stylus for these non wide groove discs. What is your suggestion for me?

Answer:

	
		To confirm, you wish to use the M78S cartridge body, andthe new 78 RPM records have a groove width described as microgroove.



	
		The Shure stylus N35X will fit the M78S body, will play a microgroove, and tracks from 1.5 to 3 grams.
