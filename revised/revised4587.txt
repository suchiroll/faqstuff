Question:
What is the proper wiring from an XLR, balanced, line level output to a 3.5 mm plug, TRS, unbalanced, stereo line input?

Answer:

	Cable is a two conductor (twisted pair - red and black) with cable shield.
	
	XLR pin 2 to red wire to 3.5 mm plug Tip (left channel)and to Ring (right channel). This is the send path.
	
	XLR pin 3 to black wire to 3.5 mm plug Sleeve. This is the return path.
	
	XLR pin 1 to cable shield and NO connection at 3.5 mm plug. No signal flows on the shield.
	
	
	The scheme above will typically work for a MIC level signal.
