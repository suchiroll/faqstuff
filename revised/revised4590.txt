Question:
I need your recommendations for distance from the mic using an external pop filter with the PG42USB mic. In the user manual it says that you get more bass response and a warmer sound if your are less than 6" away or touching the windscreen with your lips. It seems that being close to the mic but using a pop filter are mutually exclusive.

Answer:

	
		Excellent observation and you have discovered a law of physics for mic use.  The screen-type Pop filter must be located at a distance (3 to 6 inches) in order to be effective, but the distance keeps the singer farther from the mic; this reduces proximity effect and the warm sound it provides.
