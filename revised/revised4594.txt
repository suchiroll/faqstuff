Question:
I am installing wireless mic antennas in a gymnasium and what to protect them from basketballs and other student-launched projectiles. Guidance, please.


Answer:

	
		Antennas may be installed inside of PVC piping purchased from a home improvement store. A mounting method will have to be improvised/fabricated based on the installation site.
	
		American Time, Dassel Minnesota USA, sell open-sided polycarbonate guards for clocks, exit signs, thermostats, and other devices placed in a gym. www.atsclock.com
