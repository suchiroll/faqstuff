Question:
Can both audio outputs on the QLXD4 receiver be used simultaneously?


Answer:

	1) Yes.
	
	2) The Mic/Line Switch affects only the male XLR connector (impedance balanced.)
	
	3) The 1/4 female phone jack may be used as an unbalanced output (Tip/Sleeve), or an impedance balanced output (Tip/Ring/Sleeve.)
	
	4) The 1/4 phone jack output is about20 dB hotter than the XLR output at Mic Level.
