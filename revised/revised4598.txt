Title: PA411 units - combining the RF outputs

Question:
Is it technically feasible to passively combine the RF outputs of two PA411 PSM antenna combiners? I want to use eight P3T transmitters but only one PA805 antenna.


Answer:

	While it technically can be done by using the Shure UA221 antenna combiner/splitter, Shure does not recommend it. Note the following:
	
	1) The UA221 will introduce 3 dB of insertion loss - meaning the RF output power will be reduced by 3 dB.
	
	2) The RF power radiating from the PA805 will be the equivalent of between 10 mW and 15 mW. This will reduce the effective operating range - P3T transmitter to P3R receiver.
	
	3) Try this setup and observe the results. If all works well, excellent. If not, remove the UA221 and use a separate PA805 antenna for each PA411 RF output.
	
	4) There is an eight in / one out combiner: model PA821A.
