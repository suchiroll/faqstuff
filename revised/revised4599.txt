Question:
How can I use the PSM300 for point to point wireless? I want to send the line level output signal from my mixer to a three powered loudspeakers?

Answer:

	1) The line level output of the mixer connects into the P3T transmitter.
	
	2) Position the P3T transmitter high in the air to establish line-of-sight to the powered loudspeakers.
	
	3) At each powered loudspeaker, place a P3RA receiver. The receiver can be powered by internal batteries, or by a battery eliminator, Shure model SBC-DC.
	
	4) Use the P3RA headphone output jack as an unbalanced audio feed into the powered loudspeaker AUX IN or LINE IN connection.
