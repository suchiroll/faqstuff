Question:
My headphone amp ran out of battery while I was listening with my SE846 and it let out several loud popping sounds. These popping sounds sounded louder than the volume I had set on the device. Could this damage the SE846? If so, is there a good way to check for damage, or check that all four drivers are still working fine? Could the damage result in a reduction in quality, or would it just show up as sound distortion which can easily be noticed?

Answer:

	
		An earphone has three states of operation:
	
		
		Works
	
		Does not work
	
		Works but sounds strange.
	
		
		If your earphones (or headphones) work, but do NOT sound strange, there is no damage. Continue to use the earphones and do not worry.
