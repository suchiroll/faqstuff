Please provide details of the M97xE terminals.

Answer:

	Use a bright light to see the letters RG - L - R - LG molded into the black plastic terminal panel. Looking at the rear of the M97xE cartridge body:
	
	Upper left corner = RG = Right Ground = green ring
	
	Next lower terminal= L=Left = white ring
	
	Next lower terminal=R=Right = red ring
	
	Lower right terminalwith silver ground tab =LG=Left Ground = blue ring
