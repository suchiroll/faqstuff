Question:
On average, how long will it take for typical 1.5 VDC zinc AA cell to decline to 1.0 VDC? Also, the same information for an alkaline AA cell and lithium AA cell?


Answer:

	Assuming a constant current draw of 200 mA per hour (similar to a wireless mic transmitter):
	
	Zinc AA cell - 3 hours
	Alkaline AA cell - 9 hours
	Lithium AA cell - 14 hours
