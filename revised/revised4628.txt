Question:
I have an issue with my SRH440 headphones. Any movement of my jaw causes the left earpiece to loudly creak. Is there an approved way to lubricate the arm that connects to the earpiece?

Answer:

	Spray Silicone Lubricant is recommended. Spray a small amount into a container and create a puddle. Use an eyedropper to place the liquid silicone into the creaky plastic joint.
	
	Customer response: Thanks! I used your silicone suggestion and it seems to have worked perfectly.No more creaking.
