Question:
I have 12 UR5's and I intend to power them with an AC/DC power supply along with the Shure battery eliminator inserts. Trying to deter the power draw of each UR5 in order to select the appropriate external AC/DC supply.

Answer:

	
		With the display light off, and using two AA cells, the nominal current draw is 210 mA, or 0.210 amp. 
	
		
		Using Ohms law: 3 volts x .210 amp = 0.63 watts
