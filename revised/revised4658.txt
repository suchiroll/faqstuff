Question:
Does the SE112m+ work with Android phones?


Answer:

	Sorry, no.
	
	Phones that operate on the Android OSdo not contain the chip that can communicate with the volume control buttons on the SE112m+. Only Apple has includedthe necessary chipin their products.
	
	If you have a Samsung or other phone that uses the Android OS, the CBL-M-K mobile cable along with the SE215, SE315, SE425, or SE535 earphones should work well.
