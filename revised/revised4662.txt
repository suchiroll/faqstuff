Question:
Is the Unidyne Model 55 in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City?


Answer:

	Yes. In April 2015, the Unidyne Model 55C was added to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in the Architecture and Design department. Until January 2016, the Unidyne is part of the temporary exhibition Music Made Modern: Design for Ear and Eye. After the exhibit ends, the Unidyne will reside in the permanent collection as an icon of 20th century industrial design inspired by the Art Deco movement.
