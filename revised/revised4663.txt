Question:
I own a Rega P5 turntable and am considering installing an M97xE cartridge. Rega states that their cartridges are 14 mm tall. what is the height of the M97xE? How do I set the Vertical Tracking Angle (VTA)?



Answer:

	
		The VTA will be correct when the top of the headshell is parallel to the record.
	
		
		M97xE is 15 mm from top of the mounting flange to the bottom of cartridge body.
