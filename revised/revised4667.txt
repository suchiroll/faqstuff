Question:
Any hints on when I first charge the GLX-D battery pack?



Answer:

	1) The first charge can take several hours or longer. We recommend an overnight charge.
	
	2) When the battery is inside of the GLX-D receiver, a green battery icon will illuminate to the left of the battery when it is ready.
	
	3) The battery charge state appears on the GLX-D receiver screen only when the battery is inside of the mic/transmitter and the transmitter is powered on.
