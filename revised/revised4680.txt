Question:
I have been using the SRH440's in a pro studio.We love the sound but there is mechanical noise that can be an irritation. Please share any ideas that will help.


Answer:

	
		1) One SRH440 owner reported success in eliminating a creak by spraying silicone lubrication (sold at hardware stores) on the moving joint. Do not use oil of any type as oil can attack/soften/dissolve plastic.
	
		
		2) Another SRH440 owner added felt pads to the ear cups. See the photos below.
