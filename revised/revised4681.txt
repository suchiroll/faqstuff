Question:
I recently purchased a Shure M97xE stylus and after mounting it, I noticed the not all the brush bristles touch the record surface, and the brush bristles are cut at an angle. Please comment.

Answer:

	
		The brush bristles are indeed cut an an angle. Looking at the cartridge from the front, the bristles on the left are longer by design.To work properly, only a small section of the brush needs to contact the record groove.
	
		
		As a test, play a record without cleaning it first. If the brush is working properly, it will have collected a small ball of dust by the end of the first side.
