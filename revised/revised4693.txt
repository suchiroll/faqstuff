Question:
I tend to perspire more than other people. I wear my Shure headphones while I exercise and am concerned that the earpads will eventually begin to have a foul odor. What can I do to prevent this and clean them?



Answer:

	1) Before the headphones are stored/put away, wipe off the earpads with a clean towel or a paper towel.
	
	2) On a regular basis, wipe off the earpads using a damp rag and a small amount of Dawn dish soap. Dawn is effective at cleaning grease and oilfrom surfaces. Remove the Dawn using another rag that has only water. Then dry the earpads as in #1 above.
	
	3) Exposure of the earpads to sunlight for 60 minutes can also lessen the odor.
	
	4) Unfortunately, synthetic material as used in the earpads can eventually abosrb odor that cannot be eliminated. The earpads can be replaced on most Shure headphones. Purchase replacements from Shure Parts: 800-516-2525. Be certain to have the headphone model number before calling.
