Question:
Is the M92E stylus a nude tip or a bonded tip?



Answer:


	
		1) The stylus tip used with the M92E is bonded. It is a diamond tip bonded to a non-diamond upper piece.
	
		2) The bonded combination is mounted into a hole in the stylus shank using adhesive. Because there is no bushing on the shank, only a hole, this is called a nude mount.
	
		3) An accurate description of the M92E stylus is bonded stylus with elliptical diamond tip; nude mount to stylus shank.
