Question:
Will a Motiv product work with an Android device?


Answer:

	The Motiv MV88 stereo mic has a Lightning connector and only works on iOS.
	
	Other Motiv products are designed to operate with a device that is USB Audio compliant.  The Android 5.0 "Lollipop" operating system includes native support for USB Audio devices. To connect an Android device to a Motiv mic, an OTG (On The Go) cable is required.  
	
	Two Android apps from Extream Audio, USB Audio Recorder Pro and Audio Evolution Mobile, also work with Motiv.
