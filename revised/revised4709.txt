Question:
Will Motiv products work with a laptop docking station or bus-powered USB hub?


Answer:

	For best performance, connect the Motiv device directly to the USB port.Lap top computer docking stations can introduce noise or grounding issues, and a bus-powered USB hub may not provide sufficient power on each of its ports.
	
	As an example, the Motiv MVi needs at least 100 mA of current from the USB port.
