Question:
Do I need to set up the MV88 mic each time I use it?

Answer:

	No. Hardware settings made in the Motiv app are retained in the MV88 mic.  The "factory" setting has a flat EQ and a 90-degree stereo field.
	
	When using the MV88 to record audio for a video, it is necessary to access the Motiv app to adjust the mic gain.
