Question:
How can I reduce wind noise on my Motiv MV88 recordings?



Answer:

	The MV88 includes a foam windscreen, and the Motiv app also features a Wind Reduction setting.  
	
	For more extreme cases, use the Shure windscreen accessory, part number AMV88-FUR.  This accessory fits over the foam windscreen.
