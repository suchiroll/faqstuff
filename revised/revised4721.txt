Question:
There is a "pop" or "click" at the beginning of the recordings I made with the MV88. Suggestions?


Answer:

	The iPhones Voice Memo app does not initiate the MV88 microphone until the recording begins, so there is a brief noise as the mic powers up.Sorry, there is no workaround/solution for this, but it should not be an issue in other apps such as Shures Motiv app or GarageBand.
