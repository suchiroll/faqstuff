Question:
Will the MVL lavalier mic work with my mobile device?


Answer:

	The MVL has a male 3.5mm TRRS (Tip/Ring 1/Ring 2/Sleeve) connector that is designed to work with most smartphones and tablets. It may also work with other types of recording devices and devices that require a microphone. As there are no industry standards as to the electrical specifications of a 3.5 mm TRRS, Shure has provided the electrical MVL specifications.
