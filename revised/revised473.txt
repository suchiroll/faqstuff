Title: SCM262 Bass, Treble controls
Id: 473
Legacy Id: 483

Question:
Is there a neutral setting for the bass and treble controls on this stereo mixer?  My application is professional mics to consumer tape deck, and I don't want to alter the high/low frequencies in the output.  (Thanks!)

Answer:

	Each tone control has a center-detent position which is the flat (neutral) position.
