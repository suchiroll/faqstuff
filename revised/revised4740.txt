Question:
Will the VP83 work with the iPhone? Do,I need any special cabling? If so where would suggest purchasing said cabling?



Answer:

	To use the VP83 with an iPhone requires the use of an adapter cable, such as this one:

	Here is the reason: the VP83 output connector is a 3.5 mm phone plug withthree connection points: Tip - Ring - Sleeve.
	Tip is the Left mic output; Ring is the Right right mic output; Sleeve is the common return for Left mic and Right mic.
	
	The iPhone input connector is a 3.5 mm phone jack withfour connection points: Tip - Ring 1 - Ring 2 - Sleeve.
	Tip is Left earphone output; Ring 1 is Right earphone output; Ring 2 is common return for the earphones and the microphone; Sleeve is Mic input.
	*Note: the iPhone Mic input is monaural...not stereo.
	
	The VP83 to iPhone adapter must make these wiring alterations:
	VP83 Tip to iPhone Sleeve
	VP83 Ring to iPhone Sleeve
	VP83 Sleeve to iPhone Ring 2
	* Note the adapter sums together the Left mic output and the Right mic output.
