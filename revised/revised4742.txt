Question:
Can I use Bluetooth Earphones while using the MV88?


Answer:

	Within the MV88 Motiv App 'Recorded Files' screen, you can play back recorded files via Bluetooth - after syncing the iPhone to your Bluetooth device through the regular "settings" menu on your device.  
	
	But you cannot monitor the MV88 in real time via Bluetooth; this can be done only through the iPhone headphone jack on the device.  
	
		You can enable live monitoring (using the headphone jack) by selecting the "menu" button in the upper right corner of the MV88 Motiv App.
		
	
		Then select "Info".
		
	
		Then toggle the "Input Monitor" to the "On" position.
		
	
		Turning on this setting allows you to monitor (listen) to the MV88 mic through the headphone jack.

	Apple restricts the MV88 Motiv App to one of two states: an active USB audio stream (during recording); or a Bluetooth audio stream (during playback).
	
	Note the MV88 device itself does not use Bluetooth.  The MV88 employs a wired connection into the iPhone and feeds the two MV88 mic signals into the iPhone circuitry via circuit board conductors.
