Question:
Is the MVi headphone monitor output mono or stereo?


Answer:

	If the audio input source is monaural, such as the MVi mic input, the MVi headphone monitor output is dual mono (same thing heard in both ears).
	
	If the audio input source is stereo, such as music from a computer, the MVi headphone monitor output will be stereo.
