Question:
I have read that professional theaters make custom halo mics for the actors. What materials are used?


Answer:

	1) A miniature omnidirectional lapel microphone. This type of mic is typically offered in different colors to match skin tones.

	2) Elastic cord. Available at fabric stores in a variety of colors.

	Elastic cordis cut to fit around the actors head, above the forehead The mic cable issecured to cord using a simple knot.The two ends of the elastic cord are tied together to form a circle or halo. The miniature mic is positioned above the actors nose, with the mic grill pointed downward. The mic cable is held to the actors hair using toupee clips.
