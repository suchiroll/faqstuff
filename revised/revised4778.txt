Question:
How is a Shure WL180 series mic wired to work with a RevoLab bodypack transmitter?


Answer:

	The RevoLab devicehas DC bias and audio on pin 3.
	
	Shure employs DC bias on pin 2 and audio on pin 3.
	
	Connect the WL18x mic as follows::
	 Shure WL shield to RevoLab pin 1 ground
	 Shure WL black (audio) to RevoLab pin 1 ground
	 Shure WL red (bias) to RevoLab pin 3
	
	Though this scheme shorts the WL18x audio wire to ground, the red bias wire is now modulated with the audio signal.
