Question:
Can I use my Motiv mic with the Smule Sing karaoke app?


Answer:

	The Motiv MV5, MV51, or MV88 microphone should work with the Smule Sing app on an iPhone 5 or iPhone 6.  Connect earphones / headphones into the phone earphone jack, not the Motiv mic earphone jack.
	
	The Motiv mics do not work with Smule on an iPhone 7.
	
	Earphones / headphones that have an built-in mic may not work properly, as this mic takes priority when plugged into the phone earphone jack.  Use of the Shure EAC9BK cable should resolve the issue; a similar cable is included with the MV88. These cables have a 3.5 mm male Tip-Ring-Sleeve (TRS) connector on one end, and a 3.5 mm female Tip-Ring-Sleeve (TRS) connector on the other end.
