Question:
I remember a Three Stooges film that features the Model 55. Can you help?


Answer:

	The film was Micro-Phonies from 1945. Three Stooges Micro-Phonies
	
	At the 5 minute mark, the Stooges are in a radio broadcast studio. Moe talks into a Shure Model 55 Unidyne I mounted on a floor stand. Curly and Larry are by the sound effects table. Near the table is a Shure Model 708A Stratoliner.
	
	Later, Curly sings into a microphone that could bethe Model MI-6226 Aerodynamic Microphone from RCA.
