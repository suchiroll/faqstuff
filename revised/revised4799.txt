Question:
I have encountered a strange issue. I own QLX-D and ULX-D. Both sound great on guitar. But on some guitar setups, I've noticed that there is an odd audible noise present. Any ideas?


Answer:

	Some guitars (and other instruments) with poorly shielded or poorly grounded internal preamps / electronics can be susceptible to noise into the audio path if used with ULXD and QLXD. This is caused by a radio frequency component present in common digital transmission schemes, such as used in QLX-D and ULX-D.
	
	Sometimes the noise can be reduced by moving the wireless transmitter farther away from the guitar body. The better solution is to improve the shielding / grounding in the guitar electronics if possible.
