Title: Stylus availability for V15 III
Id: 481
Legacy Id: 491

Question:
I own a 70s-vintage V15-3 with an original VN35HE stylus, now defunct. I am very fond of the noise it makes - can Shure supply a replacement stylus and how much would it cost? Can Shure supply a stylus for the V15-3 or the M75 (ED)series for playing 78s?


Answer:

	Thereplacement stylus was model VN35MR. We no longer have any stock of these styli. Sources for Discontinued Styli and Phono Cartridges
