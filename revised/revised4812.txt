Question:
A service technician shook the KSM8 violently, like he was hammering a nail. He heard an odd noise. Comments?


Answer:

	The innovative Dualdyne cartridge design of the KSM8 offers unprecedented performancefrom a dynamic microphone. The KSM8 is extremely durable, utilizing laser and ultrasonic welding processes combined with new plastic and machined metal components.
	
	The KSM8 Dualdyne element, along with the pneumatic shock mount, operate within a sealed acoustic system; the passive rear diaphragm seals the side entry ports - typically vented to the outside air.Multiple leaks are incorporated into the sealed design to accommodate changes inbarometric pressure the microphone may encounter.
	
	If the KSM8 is vigorously shaken (axis dependent), the barometric leaks may not vent fast enough. This can result in a pop or click from the KSM8 during a techniciantest.Though this may be a typical test to ensure all is secure within a mic, it isnearly impossible to replicate this during performance due to the intense shaking required.If a noise or click is heard, note thatthere willbeno permanent damage and no change to the KSM8 performance.
