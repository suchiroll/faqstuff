Question:
The DIS-CCU can operate with either 5900-series or 6000-series components, but I don't see how to switch the mode in the browser. What's wrong?


Answer:

	You need to install the FL6000 Feature License on the DIS-CCU.Then DCS 6000 mode will appear on the System Setup page of the browser control interface.
