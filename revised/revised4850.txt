Question:
Does the MV88 work with the Periscope app?


Answer:

	The MV88 should work fine with Periscope.  Use Shure's Motiv app to make adjustments to the MV88 settings or to choose a preset mode appropriate to the recording environment and sound source.
	
	Be aware that the phone may introduce noise artifacts if it accesses cellular data while recording with a Motiv mic.  For best results, disable Periscope's access to cellular data (SettingsCellular).  This should not be an issue when the phone sends or receives data over a wi-fi network.
