Question:
Wiill the old U1 body packs work with the UR4+ receivers (assuming they are the same frequency)?


Answer:


	
		1) Frequencies must match.
	
		2) Defeat tone key squelch on the UR4 receiver. See the User Guide.
	
		3) Audio will sound funny as the companding schemes do not match.
