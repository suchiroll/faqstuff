Question:
Do you have any ideas about keeping sweat out of the UR1?

Answer:

	This idea is from a theater audio director:
	
	Seal the UR1 LCD display with 3M tape.3M offers a clear, waterproof tape that is like a box sealing tape but not as sticky.Seal the LCD display with a 1/4 overlap of tape on all four edges. Do not place the UR1 in a pouch. Make certain to wipe off the UR1 with a clean towel after each performance. Let the UR1 air-dry over night; do not place the UR1 into a zipper bag.
