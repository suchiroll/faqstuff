Question:
Can an analog wired microphone, like a Shure SM58, be connected directly into a USB port using only passive adapters?


Answer:

	No.
	
	The analog microphone signal must be converted into a digital signal that is USB compatible. A device that does this analog-to-digital conversion is known as an interface. The Shure X2U and MVi are interface devices which provide this conversion.
	
	There are also inexpensive XLR-to-USB adapter cables available, but these are not passive devices like most cables. Inside of this type of cable there is an active analog-to-digital interface activated by the DC power supplied from the computers USB port.
