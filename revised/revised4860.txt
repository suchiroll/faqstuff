Id: 4860
Legacy Id: 6047

Question:
How do I create my own presets? The 5 included are very useful but I'd also like to easily swap between my own.



Answer:

	As of February 2016, there is no method to save user presets in the Motiv app.  Your request has been sent to the MV88 product manager for consideration.
