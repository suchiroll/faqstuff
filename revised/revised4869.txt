	Recommended safe listening levels and maximum time limits according to the U.S. Federal Goverment - Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OHSA)
	
	90 dB SPL - 8 hours
	92 dB SPL - 6 hours
	95 dB SPL - 4 hours
	97 dB SPL -3 hours
	
	100dB SPL -2 hours
	102dB SPL -1.5 hours
	105dB SPL -1 hour
	
	110dB SPL -30 minutes
	115 dB SPL -15 minutes
	
	116dB SPL and above-0 minutes
	
	After years of data gathering based on the OSHA standard, 20% of people still suffered some hearing loss. There is a movement to adopt the NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health) standard, which puts the maximum exposure level for an 8 hour day at 85 dB SPL (A-weighted), and cuts the exposure time in half for every 3 dB increase; 88 dB = 4 hours, 91 dB = 2 hours, etc. Following the NIOSH standard reduced the percentage of people suffering hearing loss to 3% or 4%. Individual physiology also plays a part.
	
	Always a regular hearing exam. Ifone followsthe OSHA standard some hearing loss is noticed, then consider the NIOSH standard.
