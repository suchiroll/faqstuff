Question:
I want to control the ANI4OUT with a Crestron touchscreen. What are the API control strings?


Answer:

	The ANI4OUT can be controlled by AMX, Crestron, Extron, etc.
	
	The touch screen can control/monitor:

	
		Volume Controls
	
		Mute
	
		Metering
	
		Channel and Device Names


	The control strings can be found in the ANI4OUT User Guide.
