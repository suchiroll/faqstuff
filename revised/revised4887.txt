Question:
Can you provide some information about how my ULXD receiver integrates with Yamaha digital consoles?


Answer:

	1. Control and monitoring of ULXD receivers is ONLY available for Dante-enabled receivers, which are the dual (ULXD4D) and quad (ULXD4Q) models. ULXD4S single-channel receivers do not support this capability.ULXD firmware must be version 1.6.6 or higher.
	
	2. Compatible Yamaha consoles are the QL and CL series, running firmware version 4.
	
	3. Along with the previously available ability to patch Dante channels from ULXD receivers directly from the console, this firmware update now offers the following control and monitoring features:
	
	 a) Adjust microphone receiver gain from the console
	 b) Mute receiver channels
	 c) Name receiver channels
	 d) Identify receivers
	 e) Monitor RF level, audio level, antenna status, frequency, and battery life
	
	4.The following video from Yamaha explains how to configure the ULXD and mixing console: Yamaha Video
	
	5. The Yamaha console can support a maximum of 24 ULXD devices.
