Question:
I ordered a VP83F Mic last week, got it in the mail, read the manual, put in the batteries, pressed power and it did not turn on. I tried for hours to figure out what was wrong, tried new batteries, had other people try, nothing. Why won't this thing turn on? I've run out of ideas.


Answer:

	We have seen this problem if the batteries are not installedwith the correct orientation.
	
	
	
	
	Also, make certain to push the LEFT button for several seconds to power up the unit. Sometimes, a user presses the button with the red dot, thinking it is the power button.
