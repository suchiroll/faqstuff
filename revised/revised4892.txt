Title: VP83F Timestamp on Files
Id: 4892
Legacy Id: 6150

Question:
I need to know whether the timestamps on the WAV files from the Shure VP83F include accuracy to the second.



Answer:

	The date and time can be set manually on the VP83F in an HH:MM:SS format. On a typical Windows PC, one may view the timestamp by right-clicking on the file and selecting Properties.
