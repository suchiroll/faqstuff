Question:
Arethe M44-7 and M44G stylus shanks shaped unusually?


Answer:

	Yes. The M44-7 and M44G have type S stylus shanks (cantilevers.) The stylus shank has a subtle S shape. Type S shanks are a major contributor to the outstanding skip resistance of the M44 series when scratching a record.
