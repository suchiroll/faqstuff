Answer:

	If the blue rf light is blinking and there is no audio you will need to update your components to the latest firmware.

	
		Download theShure Update Utility from the Shure web site.
		
	
		Install the Shure Update Utility and open the Shure Update Utility.
		Click on theTools menu at the top of the screen.
		Select Check for Updates.
		Select the Firmware tab and confirm the version 2.0.0.1 or later is listed for GLX-D wireless components.
		
	
		Using the USB to Micro USB cable supplied with your GLX-D system, connect your GLX-D receiver to your computer.

				On the GLXD6 receiver the Micro USB port is located next to the audio output jack.Indicated below # 4.
