Question:
CanI usea Shure BRH440M with an iPhone 6?


Answer:

	Yes. Use a TRRS (Tip - Ring 1 - Ring 2 - Sleeve)3.5mm male phone plug (used with standard iPhone earphones) to connectthe BRH440M microphone and headphones.
	
	The BRH440M wiring designation is as follows:
	MicSend: Red wire
	MicReturn: Black wire
	Mic Ground : Shield; it surrounds the red wire and black wire
	Headphone Audio Left : Green wire
	Headphone Audio Right : Orange wire
	Headphone Audio Ground/Return : White wire
	
	Solder the BRH440M wires to the TRRS phone plug as follows:
	Tip to Green
	Ring 1 to Orange
	Ring 2 to Black, White, and Shield
	Sleeve toRed
	
	You can listen to music with the headphones when not on a phone call.When a call comes in, youll be able to hear the caller and use the microphone to talk to the caller.You will not have sidetone (return monitoring) i.e., you will not hear your voice in the headphones.
