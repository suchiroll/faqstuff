Question:
Just received my MV88 and it looks and sounds great. Can you recommend a lightning extender that works well with the MV88 so I can use my iPhone with the case on?


Answer:

	Some extension cables should work with the MV88, but others are suitable only for charging.  Customers report success with cables from CableJive.
