Question:
I've recently bought a CVG 18 gooseneck, and I need to know how to lock the mic to my church pulpit so I can't be stolen.



Answer:

	Sorry, there is no anti-theft feature for the CVG-18. We suggest securing a metal hose clamp to the mic section that protrudes below the mounting surface. The hose clamp will make the mic body too large to pull upward though the plastic ring. A hose clamp may be purchased at a hardware store.
