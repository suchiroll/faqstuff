Question:
I'm currently working with a back up computer that seems to not want to download the driver from the Motiv microphone. I was wondering if there was a link or driver that can be downloaded from Shure.



Answer:

	There is no software driver for Motiv USB mics - they should be recognized by the computers operating system as a generic USB Audio device. If the computer is not recognizing the mic, please try a different USB port. Also, the mic might not work if going through a USB hub or dock extender. Also try using a different USB cable.
