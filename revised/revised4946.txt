Question:
Did Shure ever manufacture the Beta 58A with a gold finish?


Answer:

	No. The Beta 58A has never been sold with a gold finish. Gold is a soft metal. When usedon the surface ofa microphone handle, it shows wear quickly.
	
	However, in 1995, Shure did supply a custom gold Beta 58A to the artist Prince (Rogers)for use on his tour promoting The Gold Experience album. See the photo below.
