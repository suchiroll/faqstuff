Question:
What is the wiring pin out for the older Kenwood 4 pin connector?

Here is the description of the 4 pin connector
1 = Microphone
2 = Push to Talk
3 = Chassis Ground
4 = Microphone Ground



Answer:

	
		522 wires to Kenwood pins:
	
		white = 1
	
		green = 4
	
		red = 2
	
		black = 3
	
		shield = 3
	
		522 Hi/Lo impedance switch: try both settings and use the one with the better audio results.
