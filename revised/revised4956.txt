Answer:

	Inorder to cut consumer utility costs and set higher standards of energy efficiency, the U.S. Department of Energy implemented a mandate that all external AC adapters be Level 6 energy compliant.
	
	To comply, Shure has updated its power supplies and chargers from level 5 to level 6 energy efficiency.
