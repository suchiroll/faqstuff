Question:
How effective is the MXA910's Integrated Vibration Isolation and how was this tested?


Answer:

	The MXA910 was affixed onto a calibrated vibration table with a stimulus bandwidth of 20-500 Hz. The output level of the MXA910 was measured in dBFS(A)
	
	In all cases under test, the output level of the MXA910from purely mechanical vibrations was negligible and far below the both self-noise of the microphone (listed as 11 dB SPL-A) and the acoustic noise level of the room.
	
	NOTE: Acoustical energy generated by mechanical vibration can still be picked up by the microphone in the form of sound.
