Title: Shure 522 with Yaesu two-way radio 757GX
Id: 4975
Legacy Id: 6240

Question:
I just received my new Shure 522 yesterday. I purchased it to be used on a Yaesu FT-757GX MK1. I can't seem to understand how to wire this mic to the 757gx or what position the impedance switch should be set at. The Yaesu FT-757GX MK1 has a microphone impedance of 500-600 ohms ohms through an 8-pin mic connector.

Here is the standard wiring information for this 757gx:

pin 1 up button
pin 2 shield for audio
pin 3 down button
pin 4 fast button
pin 5 fast button
pin 6 PTT
pin 7 ground wire (common)
pin 8 audio

Any help would be greatly appreciated.



Answer:

	
		1) 522 impedance switch must be set to LO.
	
		2) The 522 cannot control the UP/DOWN feature of the radio.
	
		3) Wiring:
	
		
			
				522 Green Wire to pin 8
		
	
	
		
			
				522 White Wire to pin 7
		
	
	
		
			
				522 Shield (it encircles the Green and White wires) to Pin 2
		
	
	
		
			
				522 Red Wire to pin 6
		
	
	
		
			
				522 Black wire to pin 7
		
	
	
		If the above wiring does not work, provide the 522 User Guide to Yaesu and ask their opinion.
