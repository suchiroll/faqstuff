Question:
Can I use more than one MXA910 ceiling array or MXA310 table arrays in a room? How do they connect together?


Answer:

	Yes. Just like any other microphone, you may install multiples to cover a room.
	
	The audio output from multiple ceiling arrays (or table arrays) can be combined with a mixer or external DSP (i.e. SCM820, or QSC Qsys, or Biamp). Multiple arrays cannot directly share DSP resources with each other.
	
	The microphones cannot be daisy-chained together, but by installing a small network switch with PoE under the table or in a ceiling, multiple array microphones can be locally connected and then a single cable run from the switch back to a central location.
	
	Note that each microphone must be configured independently. At this time, the embedded software in the device does not allow for multiple devices to be configured from a single interface.
	
	Shure Designer software can be used allows multiple virtual MXA910 Ceiling Array Microphones to be configured in one tool. Arrange pickup lobes over a room diagram for precise coverage; import saved settings to each MXA910 on site.
