Question:
Can I use the MXA910 Ceiling Array in a vertical/wall mount orientation?


Answer:

	Yes, though currently, the web based software is designed for ceiling-mount orientation.In order to use the MXA910 properly in a vertical orientation you need to do your own calculation, your own listening, or use the included auto-position feature.
