Question:
Besides mounting in a drop ceiling, how else can MXA910 microphones be mounted?


Answer:

	For the MXA910, there are eyelets on the back of the unit for hanging wire to suspend the mic, as well as 100mm screw holes for attaching a standard VESA-D mount to a hanging pipe (as you might with a projector).
	
	Mounting in drywall
