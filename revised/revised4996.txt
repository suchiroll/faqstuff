Question:
What additional equipment might be needed when installing MXA microphones?


Answer:

	All you need is a single Ethernet cable (shielded Cat-5e or higher recommended) connected to a Gigabit, Power-over-Ethernet source (a network switch with PoE or PoE injector). This will give you Dante digital audio and network access to the browser-based control software on the mic. If the next device in the signal chain does not support Dante digital audio, then you will need a Dante-to-analog converter, such as the Shure ANI4OUT, or a Dante to USB converter, such as the Shure ANIUSB-MATRIX (for connection to a PC).
