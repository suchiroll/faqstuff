Question:
What's the difference between the Classic and Smooth modes of automixing on the MXA310 and MXA910?


Answer:

	Smooth mode scales the off-attenuation level based on the number of channels in use. The more channels that are deployed in your configuration, the greater the off-attenuation, resulting in a smoother listening experience as lobes transition between on and off states. Classic mode is the same auto-gating style as with the SCM820 Classic mode and SCM810 automixers, where the off-attenuation level is fixed regardless of the number of channels in use.
