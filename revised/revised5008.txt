Question:
When I plug the MV51 into my iPhone, the lights on it do not come on.


Answer:

	First, the lights will only come on when you have a compatible App (such as the Motiv or camera app) opened
	
	Also, try the mic into a different iPhone or iPad. We have seen bad or dirty lightning ports that can cause this symptom.
