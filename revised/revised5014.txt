Question:
Did Shure manufactured a tri-polar microphone before the KSM44A?


Answer:

	Indeed we did.It was the model 720A, introduced in 1937. Like the KSM44A, the model 720A was switchable between Non-Directional (omnidirectional), Uni-Directional (cardioid), and Bi-Directional (figure-eight). The retail price was $39.50; in 2016 dollars, that would be $662.25.
	
	The 720Ahad two crystal elements (one omnidirectional and one bidirectional); same for the KSM44A except the elements are condenser. The 720A crystal elements were employed under a licence from the Brush Development Company: Information about Brush
	
	To create the cardioid pattern,the omnidirectional element is electronically combined with the bidirectional element.
	
	From the 1937 literature: Here for the first time is one microphone that does everything! The new Shure Tri-Polar Controlled Direction Crystal Microphone gives you all three basic directional characteristics in one microphone, each instantly available though a 3 point switch.
	
	Two technicalpapers about the model 720A can be found here: Vintage Tech Bulletins
	
	The brilliant Shure microphone engineer, Ben Bauer, wrote the following in his lab notebook, dated August 4 - 7, 1937: These days were practically completely spent on specifications and claims of tri-polar cosine element patent. Good advancement has been made.
