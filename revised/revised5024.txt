Question:
What benefits are there to SystemOn instead of third party control systems?


Answer:

	General benefits of SystemOn over using third party control strings:

	
		Shure software can be used out of the box and doesnt require any programming.
	
		Software updates can be applied easily whenever a new software release is available.
	
		It provides a direct link between Shure software and hardware.
	
		More granular control is available than what can be achieved with custom programming.


	Achieving the same feature set with third party control systems would require extensive programming, usually at high cost. Updates and new feature additions do not come as effortlessly in a third party control system or custom software.
