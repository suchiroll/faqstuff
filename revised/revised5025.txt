Question:
How does SystemOn work with solutions like Crestron "Room View"?


Answer:

	SystemOn could be an adjunct product to Crestron Room View.
	
	Room View gives high level status information about facilities and resources. The Shure software provides a more direct view into the microphone system and allows technicians to diagnose and update key settings in the Shure systems without any additional custom programming.
	
	A Crestron programmer could add a link from Room View to the Shure software for additional investigation and troubleshooting/resolution.
