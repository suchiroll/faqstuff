Question:
How do I purchase SystemOn? Is it free?


Answer:

	End users have to purchase a subscription in order to utilize the features of SystemOn. There are a few basic utilities which are available for free, however these are purely in service of the licensed features.
	
	SystemOn is sold through a subscription model, similar many to other consumer and professional software applications. A license is required for each IP addressable device that the user wishes to monitor/control through the software. Shure offers the following subscription options:

	
		Standard Subscription
	
		
			
				Covers a period of one to five years. Can be extended with renewal licenses thereafter.
			
				One subscription license is required for each IP addressable device.
			
				Includes software updates or revisions made during that time period (= maintenance)
		
	
	
		Enterprise Subscription
	
		
			
				Valid for a period of one year. Can be extended with another 1-year subscription.
			
				Covers an unlimited number of IP addressable devices
			
				Includes software updates or revisions made during that time period
		
	


	The software will launch in-app notifications 60 days, 30 days, and 1 day before the expiration to remind the user that their subscription is about to expire.
