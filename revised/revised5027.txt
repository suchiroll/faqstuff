Question:
Can I upgrade my subscription to add more licenses?


Answer:

	No. Standard subscriptions have a specific entitlement period with licenses for a set number of IP addresses/devices. If a user requires more licenses to control new or additional hardware, they can purchase an additional subscription at any time.
	
	High volume users may consider purchasing an Enterprise License, which covers an unlimited number of IP addresses.
