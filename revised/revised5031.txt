Question:
I have a Shure STL72a loudspeaker. Can Shure provide some history? It is wood, about 5 inches in diameter and looks like it was to be used on a tabletop.

Answer:

	In the 1980s, Shure marketed a complete teleconferencing systems for boardrooms. The STL72 was an accessory for this system. A = Ash - the wood was a light blonde. W = Walnut - the wood was a dark brown. See the attached data sheet below.
