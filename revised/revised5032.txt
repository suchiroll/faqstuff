Question:
Do antenna placement considerations change when using a VHF wireless microphone system instead of UHF?


Answer:

	Yes. The following recommendations apply to VHF antenna placement:

	
		Optimal distance between antennas in a diversity system: 6 feet
	
		Clear line of sight (solid objects tend to block VHF waves more so than UHF)
	
		Minimize transmitter-to-receiver antenna distance (due to higher RF noise floor in VHF, keeping antennas closer to transmitters improves signal-to-noise).
	
		For long range, or outdoor applications, UHF may be a better choice.
