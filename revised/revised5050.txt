Question:
When did the Shure Service/Repair department move from the Niles headquarters?


Answer:

	In January 2017.  Effective Monday, January 23, 2017, all product for the Service Department is to be sent to the following address with the Repair Correspondence Form (attached below):
	
	Shure Incorporated
	ATTN: Service
	945 Chaddick Dr.
	Wheeling, IL 60090-6449
	
	Business Hours for Parts & Service will be 8:00am - 4:30pm CST, Monday-Friday.
	
	Unlike the Niles IL location, a walk-up Service window will not be available at the new location. All product requiring service must be shipped to Wheeling IL.  Also, piece parts will not be sold "on site" as they were at the Niles location.
