Question:
I need a way to control camera switching with the DIS-CCU. Do you have any recommendations?


Answer:

	The Collaborate Automatic Video Switching System from 1 Beyond is an all-in-one package that includes cameras and a control system, and the API for Shure DDS 5900 has been integrated and tested by 1 Beyond for compatibility with the DIS-CCU. For more information:
