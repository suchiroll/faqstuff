Question:
Please provide history on the Shure M16 and M12 tone arms.


Answer:

	The M16 and M12 were introduced in March 1957 at the Institute of Radio Engineers national convention. The M16 was for records up to a 16 diameter; the M12 was for records up to a 12 diameter. Either tone arm could be supplied with the M1 phono cartridge - for monaural LP records; or the M2 phono cartridge - for 78 RPM records.
	
	From a Shure memo datedFebruary 12, 1957:
	In this reproducer we have attempted to incorporate every desirable feature requested by critics and engineers. For example, full range frequency response of 30,000 cycles per second --the pivots are jeweled for maximum sturdiness and minimum friction -- the arm is fully damped through the use of dynamic damping -- high output is provided without the use of transformers -- the arm is extremely stable and intended for operation at 1 gram -- it is almost impossible to damage the pickup or record by careless handling.
