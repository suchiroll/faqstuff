Question:
What is the function of the Shure product TK-1?


Answer:

	The TK-1 was a kit with crimping pliers for solderless terminal clips. The kit was housed in a cardboard box. In the box were:
	
	1 - Crimping pliers - manufactured for Shure by Klein Tools, Chicago
	75 - Solderless clips
	15 - Plastic heat-shrink tubes
	Length of copper lead wire
	
	Shure communications microphones (two-way radio types) were supplied with a coiled cable. The wires inside of the coiled cable were tinsel-type conductors in order to endure the constant flex of the coiled cable. Tinsel conductors are notoriously difficult to solder. The TK-1 kit was used to attach a solderable solid wire or stranded wire to a tinsel conductor using a solderless clip that was crimped. By extending the tinsel conductor with a solderable wire, a technician could make soldered repairs inside of a communication microphone.
