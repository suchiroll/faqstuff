Question:
How do I make a battery powered phantom power supply with an unbalanced output?


Answer:

	Battery Powered Phantom Power Supply with Unbalanced Output

	The schematic below illustrates an 18 volt phantom supply. It will supply any Shure microphone that requires phantom power. Battery life is dependent on the current drain of the microphone. To estimate the battery life in hours, divide 400 by the microphones current drain in milliamps. For example, the Shure SM81, with a current drain of 1.2 milliamps, will operate for about 330 hours. The use of premium alkaline batteries is recommended.
	
	Schematic is for 18 volt power supply. Output must feed an unbalanced input.
	

	
	

	
		
			
				C1, C2 = 100F, 35V
				D1 = 1N4001 or equivalent
				R1, R2 = 2.2k, 1/4W, 1%
				R3 = 100k, 1/4W, 5%
				S1 = SPST
				This circuit must be in a metal enclosure
				Pin 1 must be grounded to the enclusore
