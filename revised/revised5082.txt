							Same Frequency Band. All wireless channels share same frequency code (G3, J1, M1)
					
				
				
					
						
					
						
					
						
				
				
					
						
							Choose either ULXP or ULXP/ULXS system setup

											ULXP (Professional). All wireless systems share the same frequency code and are ULXP systems.
									
								
							
						
					
					
						
					
						
							
								
									
										
											ULXP  ULXS Systems. All wireless systems share the same frequency code but are a combination of ULXP and ULXS systems with at least one ULXP system.

											Group Scan. Perform a Group Scan on the ULXP receiver. Hold [SET] while pressing [MODE]. Group Scan will flash. Rotate Scroll wheel to start group scan.

											Group Setup. Setup all remaining receivers to recommended group from scan results. Push [MODE] twice, Rotate scroll wheel to desired group, Push [SET] twice to lockin the group.

											Channel Scan  Transmitter Setup. Once all receivers are on the same group, perform a channel scan. Push [MODE], then rotate scroll wheel (or push up arrow on ULXS), Push set to lock to flashing channel. Set transmitter to group  channel setting. Hold [MODE] on transmitter for 3 seconds. Channel # will disappear. Push [SET] until desired group is reached. Push [MODE] to switch to channel setup. Push [SET] until desired channel is reached. Push [MODE] to lock transmitter to settings. RF indicatorson receiver will illuminate. Repeat scan  transmitter setup process with remaining systems. NOTE: You must leave transmitters on after each system setup to ensure the channel scan does not duplicate frequency selection.
