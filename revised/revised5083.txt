							Same Frequency Band. All wireless channels share same frequency code (G1, H4, J5, L3, or X1)
					
				
				
					
						
					
						
					
						
				
				
					
						
							Choose either network or non-network path

											Networked Receivers. Receivers are networked together using an Ethernet Router  the network icon is showing in the UHF-R Display.
									
								
							
						
					
					
						
					
						
							
								
									
										
											
												
													Non-Networked Receivers. Receivers share the same frequency band but are not networked together using a router.

										Group Scan. Perform a Group Scan. Press [RADIO][SCAN] [GROUP SCAN]. Results will show the best group and # of available frequencies. Push Flashing [ENTER]
								
							
						
					
				
				
					
						
							
								
									
										
											Group Scan. Perform a Group Scan. Press [RADIO][SCAN][GROUP SCAN]. Results will show the best group and # of receivers found. Push the flashing [ENTER] button. Frequency setup will be performed.

											Group Setup. Setup all remaining receivers to recommended group from scan results. Push [RADIO]. Rotate scroll wheel on highlighted [G:] to recommended group. Push flashing [ENTER] when finished.

											Transmitter Sync. Turn on one transmitter and open battery door. Hold sync window on transmitter up to the sync window on desired receiver (far left hand side). Push [SYNC] on receiver. Push [SYNC] again to lock transmitter to proper receiver. Orange RF lights should appear after sync. Repeat process with remaining transmitters.

											Channel Scan  Sync. Perform a channel scan with first receiver. Push [RADIO] [SCAN][CHANNEL SCAN] then [ENTER] when finished. Lock the transmitter to the receiver by performing Transmitter Sync. Leaving the transmitter on. Repeat channel scan  sync with remaining systems. PLEASE NOTE: After performing the transmitter sync, it is essential to leave the transmitter on so the following receiver does not select the same frequency.
