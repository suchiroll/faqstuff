Question:
Theater Audio - Feedback when using microflex overhead microphones

Answer:

	There will be very little difference between the cardioid and supercardioid at those distances. The solution is to get the microphones closer to the performers.

	Microphone choice is not going to make much difference in your setup. Feedback is most greatly effected by the distance between the microphone and the talker and the distance between microphone and the loudspeaker. The only solution for you is to get the microphones closer to the people on stage and to get the microphones further away from the loudspeakers. The distance that a microphone can pick up is dependent on the rest of the sound system.
