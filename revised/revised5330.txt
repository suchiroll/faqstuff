Question:
Wireless Troubleshooting Hints

Answer:

	Troubleshooting Wireless Microphone Systems

	

	Even when wireless microphone systems appear to be properly selected and set up, problems may arise in actual use. While it is not practical here to offer comprehensive solutions for all possible situations some general guidelines are suggested.

	
	Though problems with wireless microphone systems eventually show up as audible effects these effects can be symptoms of audio and/or radio problems. The object of troubleshooting in either situation is first to identify the source of the problem and second to reduce or eliminate the problem.

	
	The following abbreviations are used below:

	
		AF = audio frequency
	
		RF = radio frequency
	
		RFI = radio frequency interference
	
		TX = transmitter
	
		RCV = receiver


	

	A common symptom in multiple system operation is apparent activation of two receivers by a single transmitter. This can be due to one of several causes: operating frequencies the same or too close, crystal harmonics, transmitter at the image frequency of the second receiver, IM with an unknown source, etc. If activating the second transmitter results in proper operation of both systems this effect can usually be ignored. Recommended operating procedure is to turn up a receiver only when its transmitter is active. If it is desired to allow open receivers without transmitters, readjusting the squelch settings may suffice. Otherwise the operating frequencies may have to be changed.

								When multiple systems are in use some additional problems can occur due to interaction between the systems. Turning individual systems on and off and trying systems in different combinations can help to pinpoint the cause. However, this can become much more difficult as the number of systems increases.
								
									Following are some multiple system troubleshooting suggestions for symptoms observed when all systems are active.
