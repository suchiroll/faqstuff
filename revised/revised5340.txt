Question:
AP200K cable information

Answer:

	AP200K: This is a cable assembly that allows a user to adjust the level of an ambient mic, such as the Shure WL93(not supplied), that connects into the P2R 1/4 input jack. The AP200k consist of a TA4M connector, preamp module, and male TRS 1/4 plug. The preamp provides 12dB gain to the signal from the ambient mic; the output level adjustable via a thumbwheel potentiometer. The preamp also passes the 5V bias supply on the ring of the 1/4 TRS jack to the bias pin of the mic (pin 2). There is a 3dB low end roll off at 130Hz. The input impedance is approximately 20,000 ohms.

	

	

	
		5V Bias supply from P2R is passed to the preamp and to lavalier mic.
	
		Provides 12dB gain, output level adjusted through thumbwheel control.
	
		Provides 130Hz 3dB down point for low end roll off to reduce effects of stage rumble in monitor mix.
	
		With Gain Potentiometer at full volume and the input shorted to ground, preamp output is  -90dBu A-weighting and 30kHz filter ON
	
		Cable lengths provide convenient cable management for performers.
	
		Preamp case allows easier handling and control over thumbwheel.
	
		20Kohms input impedance
	
		Zero Position on Preamp will not pass any audio from the ambient mic.
