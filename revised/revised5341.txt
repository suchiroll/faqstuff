Question:
AP201K Cable Information

Answer:

	AP201K: This is a cable assemble designed to allow a user to sum together an ambient mic signal and a line level signal into their P2R Aux input jack. The cable consists of a male TRS 1/4 jack, preamp module, TA4M connector and a female 1/4 connector. The preamp provides a 3dB down point at 130Hz for low end roll off. The preamp provides 12dB of gain to the mic input if no line level signal is inserted into the female 1/4 jack.When the line level signal is present its signal level at the  TRS output is attenuated by -6dB . The mic input gain is reduced to +6dB when the 1/4 line level input is present. The preamp input impedance is approximately 20 kohms and the line level input impedance is approximately 100 Kohms.

	

	

	
		Sums a line level signal with preamp output for independent control of two signal levels in P2R Aux In monitor mix.
	
		5V Bias supply from P2R is passed to the preamp and to lavalier mic.
	
		Provides 12dB gain to mic input with no line level input and 6dB mic gain with a line level input. The microphone output level is adjusted through thumbwheel control.
	
		The line level input has a -6dB attenuation.
	
		Provides 130Hz 3dB down point for low end roll off of mic input to reduce effects of stage rumble in monitor mix.
	
		Preamp input impedance is approximately 20Kohms.
	
		Line Level Input impedance is approximately 100Kohms.
	
		Cable lengths provide convenient cable management for performers.
	
		Over molding of Summer PCB provide rugged Y Junction.
	
		Preamp case allows easier handling and control over thumbwheel.
	
		Zero Position on Preamp will not pass any audio from mic input.
