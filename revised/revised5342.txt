Question:
PA213 Cable Information

Answer:

	PA213: This cable is designed for the guitarist who is completely wireless and uses a P2R for their monitor and a body pack transmitter that takes a 1/4 jack as input. This cable allows a guitarist to control their own level in their monitor mix and still have a wireless transmitter split. The cable assembly is designed to allow a guitarist to split their guitar output into two separate signals that would feed the P2R Aux Input and a body pack transmitter as well. The cable assembly consists of 2 male mono 1/4 connectors, 1 male 1/4 TRS connector, a preamp and a splitter board. The split that feeds the P2R Aux input passes through the inline preamp. This provides the user with a 6dB gain with adjustable output level through a thumbwheel potentiometer. This allows the performer to control how much of their guitar signal is fed into their P2R Aux input. The preamp also provides a 3dB down point at 52Hz. The input impedance is approximately 500Kohms.
	
	

	
		Provides split for guitar signal to feed P2R Aux input and 1/4 input body pack transmitter.
