Question:
PSM 1000 Firmware 1.3.1 Compatibility

Answer:

	
		Firmware version 1.3.1 is available and required for P10Ts to work with Axient hardware.
	
		Most P10Ts are on firmware version 1.1.0, and this version is not compatible with P10Ts running version 1.3.1
	
		All P10Ts on the same network must be running the same firmware version.
	
		The latest (and only) firmware for P10Rs is still version 1.1.0.This firmware will work perfectly with P10Ts on either version of firmware.
