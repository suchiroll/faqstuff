Id: 537

Question:
I have an opportunity to acquire 2 AMS8000 mixers, but no AMS microphones. Although they may not work to peak efficiency, will the mixers still perform their auto-mix functions with regular condenser mics?


Answer:

	Sorry, the AMS mixers will only work properly with the AMS microphones.
