Question:
Technical differences between ULXD, QLXD, PGXD, and GLXD

Answer:

	Frequency Band
	PGX-D: 902-928 MHz*
	GLX-D: 2.4 GHz
	QLX-D: 176-216, 470-928 MHz*
	ULX-D: 176-216, 470-928 MHz*
	*Country Dependent
	
	Maximum Simultaneous Systems Under Optimal Conditions
	PGX-D: 5
	GLX-D: 4
	GLX-D Advanced: 11
	QLX-D: 60
	ULX-D: 100 using high density mode
	*Local RF interference will reduce these numbers.
	
	Maximum Operating Range Under Optimal Conditions
	PGX-D: Up to 200 feet
	GLX-D: Up to 100 feet indoors; Up to 65 feet outdoors
	QLX-D: Up to 300 feet
	ULX-D: Up to 300 feet using standard density mode
	*Local RF interference will reduce these distances.
	
	Transmitter DC Power
	PGX-D: Two AA cells
	GLX-D: Shure SB902 Rechargeable
	QLX-D: Two AA cells or Shure SB900A Rechargeable
	ULX-D: Two AA cells or Shure SB900A Rechargeable
	
	Receiver Antennas
	PGX-D: Permanently attached -wave
	GLX-D: Permanently attached -wave
	GLX-D Advanced: Removable -wave
	QLX-D: Removable -wave (no DC voltage for antenna amps)
	ULX-D: Removable -wave (has DC voltage for antenna amps)
	
	Rack Mount
	PGX-D: URT2 accessory (not included)
	GLX-D: URT2 accessory (not included)
	GLX-D Advanced: Hardware included
	QLX-D: Hardware included
	ULX-D: Hardware included
	
	Latency
	PGX-D: 3.5 ms
	GLX-D: 4 ms minimum; 7.3 ms maximum
	QLX-D: 2.9 ms
	ULX-D: 2.9 ms
	
	Sampling Rate
	PGX-D: 48k
	GLX-D: 44.1k
	QLX-D: 48k
	ULX-D: 48k
	All use 24 bit sampling resolution.
