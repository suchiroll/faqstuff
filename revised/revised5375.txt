Question:
DIS DCS-6000 and DDS-5900 Interconnect Cables

Answer:

	Specifications for the DIS DCS-6000 and DDS-5900 discussion system interconnecting cables:

	
		Cable type: CAT-5E (or better, i.e. CAT-6)
	
		Wire gauge:24 AWG minimum (smaller cables such as 26 AWG will limit the number of chair/delegate stations that can be daisy chained)
	
		Stranded or solid:yes - but stranded is recommended for better flexibility and handling in all applications
	
		Cable Shielding:required - F/UTP (overall foil shield, formerly known as FTP) or U/FTP (individual foil shield on each pair, formerly known as STP) or better
	
		RJ-45 Connectors: shielded, to match cable and wire type; connectors with a latch tab protector are preferred
	
		Cable Shield Termination:shield drain wire must be terminated to RJ-45 connector shield tab at both ends


	For permanently installed cables, consider terminating with an RJ-45 jack connector, instead of a plug connector.The RJ-45 jacks are easier to field install since they use a punch-down type termination.
