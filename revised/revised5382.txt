Question:
GLXD4 Output Signal Level

Answer:

	The nominal XLR output signal level of the GLXD4 receiver is -40dBV. This is a typical output level of a high impedance microphone or a guitar with passive magnetic pickups.
	
	The GLXD4 gain adjustment range is 60 dB (-20 dB below nominal to +40dB above nominal), or from -60dBV to 0dBV.
