Question:
What is the wire color coding for the GE mics EM33F and EM25M? I believe these mics were made by Shure for GE.


Answer:

	For the EM33F, the white and shield are the audio; the red and black are switch leads for Push-To-Talk.
	
	For the EM25M, the red and shield are the audio; the white and black are switch leads for Push-To-Talk.
