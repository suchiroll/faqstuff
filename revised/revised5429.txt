Question:
We just purchased this today, recorded several (successful) tests, and then proceeded to record a 45min interview. I checked several times during the recording to confirm the interview was still being recorded. It was. When the conversation concluded, I stopped the recording by pressing the red record/stop button.

I then attempted to save the recording by tapping the checkmark. no response. I tapped again with no response. I proceeded to tap another two dozen times, but the app did not respond to give me the opportunity to save the 45 minute interview I had just conducted. After trying other creative maneuvers to no avail, I finally attempted to record a new clip in hopes of making something happen. The app did gladly respond to that tap, allowed me to stop it, and then allowed me to save it.

Problem is, the previous 45 minute interview we had just recorded was completely lost. In a nutshell, that's the problem with Motiv (2.1.1.3) that I'd really love to see addressed and 'improved'.
