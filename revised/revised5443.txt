Question:
What Shure model was the primary stage microphone for the Woodstock Festival in August 1969?

Answer:

	The majority of onstage microphones were the Shure Unisphere I Model 565. The U.S. retail price was then $100. The 1969 standard version of the Model 565 employed a four pin Amphenol connector. However, some of the Woodstock 565 microphones had been modified to accept a female XLR cable connector. A machined metal collar was added to the mic handle to hold the 3 pin male XLR connector.
