Question:
My local mosque needs a comprehensive public address system.The dimension of the mosque is 2km square. I want you to help to help size the followings:

1.An amplifier
2.A mixer
3.Wired microphones {4}
4.Wireless microphones {2}
5.The Vocal Artist UHF {2}
6.The Presenter UHF {2}
7.Professional stand alone speakers {10}
8.All accessories of 1-7

Please,send the necessary prices for importation. All products must be rugged and are meant for outdoor application.


Answer:

	Shure does not design complete sound systems. For that service, contact a local installer of sound systems or a sound system designer, often called an acoustical consultant. A system for a mosque of this size will be quite complex. Certainly not a do-it-yourself project.
	
	To help you educate yourself, please read the following book: Audio Systems Guide for Houses of Worship
	
	Regarding importing the products, please tell us what country you are in and we will give you the name of your Shure agent.
