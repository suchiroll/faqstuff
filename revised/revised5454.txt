Question:
I have an SCM820. I purchased the A820-NIC-DANTE and installed it, but now the SCM820 does not boot up. What can I do?

Answer:
If the SCM820 was on older firmware than what the A820-NIC-DANTE was expecting, this problem can occur. Make certain you update the SCM820 to the latest firmware before installing the A820-NIC-DANTE
