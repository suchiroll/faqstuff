Question:
How many SCM820-DAN can be connected together? I'm designing a system with 64 microphones.

Answer:
SCM820-DAN mixers can be linked to form large automixes of up to 12 units (96 channels of audio). Mixers in the same link group operate under shared IntelliMix settings. A back-panel auto link button enables mixers to automatically link when they join the network. To link specific mixers, custom groups can be created and managed from the GUI.
