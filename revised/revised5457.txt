Question:
Can I pole mount the MXA910? Does Shure offer a pole mount for it?

Answer:
Yes, the MXA910 can be poll mounted. The rear plate on the microphone has 4 threaded holes for attaching the microphone to a VESA mounting device. The mounting holes follow the VESA MIS-D standard:Screw specification: M4 thread (Microphone threaded hole depth = 9.15 mm)Hole spacing: 100 mm (square)Shure does not offer a pole mount, but pole mounts from companies, such as Chief or B-Tech, will work with the MXA910.
