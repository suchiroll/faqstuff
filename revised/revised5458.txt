Title: Disqualified Network Switches for Shure Dante Devices
Id: 5458
Legacy Id: 

Question:
Are there any network switches that Shure knows do NOT work well with Shure network products, such as the MXW, MXA310 or MXA910?

Answer:
In addition to the network switches mentioned in Audinate’s “list of incompatible, unmanaged switches with Energy Efficient Ethernet,” the following switches are not compatible with Shure Dante enabled devices.
We strongly recommend using Gigabit Ethernet Managed Switches. For example: Cisco SG200/300 series, or D-Link DGS-1210 switches. Unmanaged switches with EEE or Green Energy Efficient Ethernet should not be used for Dante networks.
