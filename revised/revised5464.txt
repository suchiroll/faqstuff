Question:
What are the specifications for the PoE ports on Axient Digital? How many devices can it power?

Answer:
Axient Digital receivers provide four Ethernet ports: Two Dante-enabled Ethernet ports and two network Control Ethernet ports with PoE support for a single Class 1 device.A single Class 1 device can be on either of the Control ports but only one port will be granted power for the external device. If a second Class 1 device is connected to the open port it will not be powered.AD4 can sufficiently power an AXT610 and AD610. Unfortunately our MXA and ANIs arenâ€™t compatible with AD4 due to power requirements (they are Class 0).
