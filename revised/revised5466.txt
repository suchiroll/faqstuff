A Small Unidirectional Dynamic Probe Microphone* ERNEST SEELER Shure Brothers, Inc., Evanston, Illinois This paper describes a unidirectional dynamic microphone of small size utilizing the "uniphase" system.1 Under idealized conditions the elements of the phase shift network employed can be shown to be functions of the independent variables: (a) the inertance of the back entry, (b) its resistance and (c) the distance of the two sound-entries. Under real conditions certain modifications of the phase shift network are necessary; these are described, as is a partially laminated Mylar diaphragm used. THE requirements for a pressure-gradient unidirectional microphone for use in public address systenis can be summarized as being: small size, in order to be unobtrusive; a suitable frequency response and output level available from low and high impedance output connectors; a random energy response equal or less than 1/3, therefore indicating a cardioid, super-cardioid2 or hyper-cardioid3 polar pattern as desirable; a uniform discrimination over the audio spectrum transmitted, to avoid feedback at frequencies otherwise favored by the microphone; a polar pattern of rotational symmetry having the major axis of the microphone as axis of rotation, so that positioning of the microphone or of the loudspeakers becomes less critical; a stable acoustic phase shift network within the microphone to insure proper acoustic performance during its life time—an objective not easily attained with network components (particularly mechanical) required to be in delicate balance for a long period of time; and, finally, low mechanical noise sensitivity as well as high blast or "pop" resistivity. The requirements of both small size and uniform discrimination over the audio-frequency range are somewhat contradictory, because the polar pattern of a pressuregradient microphone as well as the characteristics of its phase shift network collapse at certain frequencies. In order to maintain proper performance at these frequencies, use is made of the phenomenon of diffraction of sound by the microphone case. Generally, the smaller the case dimensions, the higher the frequencies of incident sound must be to cause desirable diffraction effects, demanding, therefore, an increased frequency range of the phase shift network. A solution of these problems has been attempted with the design of a first order pressure-gradient microphone based on a refined version of the "uniphase" system.4 This system utilizes a single transducer together with an acoustic phase shift network so arranged as to react to the phase shift 27rf (d/c) cos 0 which occurs between two points in space immersed in a sound field of plane progressive waves, * Presented October 12, 1960 at the Twelfth Annual Convention of the Audio Engineering Society, New York.

It is to be noted that condition (3) does not include requirements for Z3, i.e., for the diaphragm parameters. The network of Fig. 2 does not permit an analytical solution of (3); the approximate values of the network parameters have been ascertained by substitution, trying to obtain in the relation 1 + Z1/Z2 = ae (4) the values a = a(e) 1 and /3 = /3(w) 1 for as wide a frequency range as possible, where a and /3 are real functions of For low frequencies, however, it is possible to obtain .0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0,6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 q .5 .7 P.O 2.0 4.0 7.0 10.0 Fin. 3.

In ortler to ascertain the frequency at which a given deviation from the desired values a. = 1, /3 = 1 occurs, a and /3 could be calculated using Eqs. (4) to (10).

Equation (15) can be represented by a circuit in which the pressure 2PKw acts upon a series-impedance consisting of R1, L1, L3 and C3. At frequencies well below fi the system is stiffness-controlled and U 2PKC30)2 shows a 12 db per octave rise, while for frequencies well above Ji the system is mass controlled and U 2PK/(L1 + L3) is independent of frequency. The intermediate region can be controlled, i.e., the diaphragm can be suitably damped, by the acoustic resistance R1. The resonance frequency fi can be decreased by increasing the acoustic inertance L1 of the back-entry path without altering the mechanical resonance frequency J of the diaphragm. This is a useful method for decreasing the mechanical shock sensitivity of the microphone without changing its frequency response at the lower frequencies. However, the increase in L1 also decreases the level of the microphone U 2PK/(L1 + L3), since L3 is mainly a voltage-generating mass represented by the voice coil. It must be observed that the equations derived above are based on a number of assumptions: neither d, the effective acoustical distance between the diaphragm and the back opening, nor the effective area of the diaphragm, which is used to transform the mechanical impedance of the diaphragm into its acoustical analogue Z3, are independent of frequency; in addition, the calculations are based on a sound field consisting of plane progressive waves (in the case of spherical waves, for instance, d is dependent on the distance to the sound source); only at low frequencies, furthermore, is it permissible to represent the network parameters by lumped circuit elements; finally, the effects of the diffraction of sound around the microphone have been neglected, although diffraction contributes significantly to the unidirectional characteristics at high frequencies. The physical forms of the circuit elements, therefore, have to be given a suitable geometry in order to present distributed impedances which—in combination with the effects of diffraction—will perform properly at high frequencies. Also, in order to balance some of these effects, it may not always be most favorable to aim at the condition a 1, = 1 over the entire frequency range of the phase shift network. Based on the foregoing, a microphone has been designed meeting the requirements previously outlined. Particular attention has been given to the development of a suitable diaphragm, which is shown in Fig. 4. It is molded of Mylar polyester film, a material admirably suited for this purpose because of its excellent physical and chemical characteristics, which are retained over a long period of time. The diaphragm is partially laminated and is contoured to obtain the greatest possible ratio of the fundamental to the frequency of the first overtone, in order to insure a smooth frequency response. The contour, by means of suitably molded passages, also permits relatively unimpeded vibrations of air underneath the surface of the diaphragm, especially in the area where the voice coil connects the diaphragm, thereby reducing an acoustical resistance component otherwise included in R3. Another advantage of this contour is the ease with which the diaphragm compliance can be controlled by only one dimension of the contour, without changing the thickness of the diaphragm material. Of course, larger changes of compliance can be obtained by changing the thickness of this material—production techniques have been developed which easily permit the forming of Mylar as thin as 4 mil. The frequency response of this system for 6 = 0°, 900, and 180° is shown in Fig. 5, while the polar response for various frequencies at a distance of 24 in. from the sound source is shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen, a very slightly distorted cardioid at 70— with a 180°-discrimination of 13 db develops into a true cardioid at 125—j with a 6 db 90 0 discrimination, therefore indicating a random energy response of 1/3. The 90° discrimination increases with frequency and reaches a value of 20 db at 10 kc, while at 3.2 kc a back lobe appears, which increases in magnitude to a 180°-discrimination of 12 db at 10 kc, tending towards a hyper-cardioid performance with a random energy response of 1/4. In order to insure rotational symmetry of the polar pattern, all microphone parts contributing to acoustical performance have rotational symmetry with the major axis of the microphone as the axis of rotation. Figure 7 is a photograph of the completed microphone showing a microphone cartridge with its magnetic structure, diaphragm and a part of the phase shift network. The microphone case provides room for the acoustic capacitance C5, a microphone transformer, and a shock mount designed to isolate the cartridge from mechanical vibrations transmitted through the microphone case. A grille in front of the diaphragm provides suitable blast protection. The case end has a conical configuration and can be inserted into a swivel mount, if desired. The performance of this microphone in talk tests under severe conditions is excellent, proving the validity of the design principles outlined above.
