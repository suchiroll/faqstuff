Question:
Did Shure ever sell an OEM version of a ribbon microphone?

Answer:
Yes.  In the 1950s, Shure sold an OEM version of the Model 300 ribbon microphone to Stromberg-Carlson.  It featured a badge with the Stromberg-Carlson name. The OEM model number was MG-58.  [MG may have stood for Microphone Gradient.] The specifications were the same as the standard Shure Model 300.
