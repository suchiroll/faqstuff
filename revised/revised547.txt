Question:
I need to carry my needles once a week to my job, and I have already ruined one stylus in the process.  Do you have any recommendations for transporting them safely?

Answer:

	To transport styli safely, go to a drug store and purchase a seven day pill organizer. It is made of plastic, has seven compartments each with a snap tight lid, and is typically about 7 inches long. It will safely hold a typical replacement stylus in each compartment.
