Question:
I have a ULX-D system in the J50 band. Since part of the tuning range will continue to be legal to use after the incentive auction transition, can I band-limit my devices to be compliant with the new regulations?

Answer:
You can permanently band-limit your devices to operate in permitted bands per the new FCC regulations using the U.S. 600 MHz Conversion Tool (built into Wireless Workbench) if you own any of the following, operating in the following affected frequency bands:

	Axient® (AXT) Wireless Management Network – J5 or L3 bands
	ULX-D® Digital Wireless System – J50 or L50 bands
	QLX-D® Digital Wireless System – J50 or L50 bands
	PSM® 1000 Wireless Personal Monitor System – J8 or L8 bands
Information about the conversion.
