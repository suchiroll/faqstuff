Question:
I own a Yamaha P-30 turntable (built in the middle 80's) that has a CG-8300 cartridge with a N-8300 stylus.  I am having a very hard time finding a replacement stylus.  Could you tell me if you have a replacement for the N-8300 stylus, and if not, what replacement cartridge do you recommend.

Answer:

	We do not believe the CG-8300 is a Shure cartridge, so we do would not have a replacement stylus for it.
	
	We cant recommend cartridges for specific turntables, as we dont have specifications for most of them. See the following link for information on a new cartridge:
	
	What phono cartridge will fit my turntable?
