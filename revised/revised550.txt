Question:
I have a Shure tone arm model M-232. I am wondering if the removable headshells are still available for it. and if so, where can i obtain them? Also, I have an M-97 Cartridge body, which i would like to purchase a new stylus for if these are still available? 

Answer:

	The M232 tone arm was discontinued over 25 years ago. Shure has not had any replacment parts for this product since 1985.
	
	As of January 2001, replacement styli for the M97 are still available from Shure Parts. Call 800-516-2525 for details.
