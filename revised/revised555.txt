Question:
I have an older Shure mic with ALM Modulink cable. What is the function of each wire/pin in the ALM cable? Where can I purchase ALM cables?


Answer:

	Shure ALM cables are configured as follows:
	
	pin 1 = no connection
	pin 2 = red wire = bias voltage and audio
	pin 3 = yellow wire = push-to-talk switch
	pin 4 = blue wire = hang-up button (on back of mic)
	pin 5 = black wire = ground for push-to-talk switch
	pin 6 = white wire = unamplified audio (direct from mic element)
	pin 7 = silver wire = ground for audio
	pin 8 = no connection
	
	As of January 2005, Shure discontinued all ALM cables. The supplier for many of the Shure ALM cables was Whitney Blake.

	New London Technology, Inc.(434-525-0068) has some ALM cables still in stock as of 2010.
	
	Whitney Blake fabricates connecting cables for communications products and may be able to provide a substitute for your ALM cable.
