Id: 556
Legacy Id: 567

Question:
Is there any possibility of your reissuing your consumer trackability test records? There are a few others around, but I am not as sure of their objective scientific tests as I am of yours.


Answer:

	As of January 2001, we have no plans to re-issue test records. We suggest you try used record stores or Ebay.
