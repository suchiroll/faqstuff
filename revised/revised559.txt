Question:
I am planning very seriously to purchase a DFR11EQ. But still I have a question regarding the functionality of your product. Is there any possibility that I connect this processor via mono in order to use it with 2 or 3 mics simultaneously? Would it respond well this way? I want to know this because my budget would be really jeopardized if I consider having 1 DFR for each channel, and the stereo mode is not really important for me. Your kind answer will really help me out.Thanks a lot,

Still,IÂ´ve seen in a few pro sound gear retailer websites, that they refer to the product we have talked about as a DFR11EQ5, note the "5" at the end. Is this a different or newer model? Thanks again and best regards.


Answer:

	The DFR11EQ should be placed between the mixer and the amplifier. Therefore, you can run as microphones as you wish into the mixer. The DFR11EQ will have no problem with 3 microphones plugged into your mixer. The DFR11EQ is a mono device and does not offer a stereo mode.
