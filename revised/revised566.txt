Question:
I just purchased a Beta Green 4.0. I already own a 4.1, and found this 4.0 tonight. It appears to be the EXACT same model as the 4.1, with a slightly different label. What is the difference?


Answer:

	There is no difference between the BG 4.0 and the BG 4.1; the model number was changed to reflect new packaging. The BG 4.0 was the predecessor to the BG 4.1.
