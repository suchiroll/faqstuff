Title: Beta 98 head on WL185 body
Id: 568
Legacy Id: 579

Question:
I need to mount a Beta 98 in a position where the cord will exit at a right angle. I notice that the element mounts to its body with the same contacts and threads as a WL185. Are the internal electronics of the Beta 98 and the WL185 identical? Will the difference in bodies affect the EQ or polar pattern?


Answer:

	The Beta 98 body includes a 15 dB pad (attenuator). This pad is not in the WL185 body. There will be no EQ or polar pattern difference if you use the WL185 body.
	
	The combination of the Beta 98 element, the WL185 body, and the Beta 98 preamp will handle a maximum SPL of 140 dB.
