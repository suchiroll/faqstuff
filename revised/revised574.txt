Question:
I can't decide on a mic. I plan to buy a wireless system and need to know what mic is best: SM58, Beta58A, SM87, or Beta87A. Please tell me your opinion.


Answer:

	Yours is a common question, but it is the same as asking a stranger: What food will I like to eat? Your choice of microphone is a personal decision and only you can make that decision by hearing what each mic does to your voice. As a musician, would you buy a instrument without playing it or hearing it?
	
	We suggest you read Microphone Techniques for Music - Studio Recording at Shure Educational Articles
	This will educate you on the different types of microphones and their general characteristics.
	
	Of the models you listed, the Beta 87 is the mic most often used by touring sound companies when supporting major acts playing the biggest arenas. Check out the Artists portion of the Shure web site to read about major artists and their mics.
