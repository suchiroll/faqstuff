Title: Phono cartridges for 1974 AR turntable
Id: 578
Legacy Id: 590

Question:
My turntable is still in good shape, and is in need of a new phono cartridge, which initially was the V15 Type III (HE?).  The AR's tone arm is 'S'-shaped, and the cartridge shell has the slide-on connectors that fit on the four gold-plated pins on the rear of the cartridge.  As I don't want to spend a fortune for a new one, I wanted to know my alternatives as to the upper and middle ranges - price and performance-wise, as well as any local distributors here in Austin, TX.  Thanks for your time.
