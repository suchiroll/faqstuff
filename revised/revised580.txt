Title: Stylus for V15RS

Question:
I have a Realistic cartridge (V15RS) with a Shure stylus. Can you give me a replacement model number for the stylus. The one I have has no number. Radio Shack has several models that look similar.

Please verify the number and,if you can, offer an alternative. Thank you.

	If Radio Shack does not have a stylus, then you will need a new cartridge.
