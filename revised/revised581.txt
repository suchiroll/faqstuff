Question:
I need to connect a small microphone to a line input. Size is critical.


Is there a small preamp (or set of specs for building one) that properly matches small microphones (e.g., 'tie clip' condenser)to line-level inputs, such as found on a VCR? I've tried a few, but had poor results (low volume, distortion, poor sensitivity, etc.).

	The FP23 is broadcast quality and has exceptional audio performance.
