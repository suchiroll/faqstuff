Title: Playing monaural LPs

Question:
What do you recommend for the best reproduction of mono LPs? 

I read in one of your FAQs that shunting the two channels of a stereo cartridge together would be an okay procedure for combing the two channels into one output line.

Would a mono cartridge (if such a thing exists) and/or stylus be give better results than stereo cartridge and stylus? 

I am starting from scratch and don't yet have a turntable. I have obtained a rare, pristine mono LP that I would love to record to CD in order to preserve it. Transferring the signal from the vinyl to a pre-amp is the most daunting of hurdles for me. I have the rest of the procedure under control. With a budget of $500, what would you recommend in the way of stylus/cartridge/turntable combination? 

I have the opportunity to purchase a used Linn Axis with Akito arm and Linn K9 cartridge. Do you sell a stylus for this cartridge that would be adequate to bring out the best from a mono LP? Thanks for any help. 

Answer:

	Paralleling the outputs of a stereo cartridge is the best approach. To our knowledge, monophonic pickups for 33 rpm LPs are no longer manufactured.
	
	A modern stereo phono cartridge is superior to monophonic cartridge as it has horizontal and vertical compliance. This will provide less record wear and damage because a monophonic cartridge tended to be very stiff in the vertical direction.
	
	A Shure stereo cartridge, wired for monaural, will do a fine job reproducing monophonic records. This monaural connection helps reduce noise caused by record wear and dirt particles in the groove.
	
	We do not make recommendations for turntables. Your cartridge selection will be based on the tracking weight range and mounting method of the turntables tonearm.
