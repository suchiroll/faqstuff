Question:
Hello, could you direct me to the proper replacement styli for an old M75ECS cartridge. Your cross reference table did not show this exact cartridge and I don't want to guess which one it takes.

Answer:

	The N75EC stylus (discontinued) track at 2 to 4 grams. Sorry, Shure no longer has an inventory of this stylus.
