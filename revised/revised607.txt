Question:
Do you repair these great old "Fat Albert"s? If not can you lead me to someone who does repairs and checkout.


Answer:

	Sorry, we do not. The SM5 series was discontinued in the early 1980s. Shure offers repair support for 10 years after a product is discontinued. We no longer have any repair parts for the SM5 series.
	
	Here is one possible source for assistance: Silvia Classic Microphones. Email is: silclass@aol.com. Telephone is: 831-461-1961. This business is located in Santa Cruz, California.
