Question:
If I am going to purchase and mount a single UC wireless receiver in a rack, do I need the UA600 to mount the antennas in the front or does the rack ears that come with the UC provide for this?


Answer:

	Yes, you require the UA600, plus the rack ears supplied with the UC wireless.

	Here are the UA600 instructions.
	
	UA600 FRONT MOUNT ANTENNA KIT
	The Shure UA600 is a front mount antenna kit for Model UC4 an and U4 UHF
	wireless receivers. To mount receiver antennas to the front of an equipment
	rack, proceed as follows:
	1 Insert the supplied bulkhead adapters into the mounting bracket holes of the rack ears.
	2 Connect the supplied 2 ft. antenna cables to the BNC connectors on the
	rear of the receiver labeled Antenna A Input and Antenna B Input.
	3 Connect each antenna cable to the rear of the bulkhead adapters.
	4 Connect the antennas to the front portion of the bulkhead adapters.
	NOTE: Shure recommends connecting the bulkhead adapter and antenna
	cables before mounting the receiver in a rack. Once the receiver is in the
	rack, it is more difficult to install the bulkhead adapters and antenna cables.
	5 Mount the receiver in a 19-inch audio equipment rack.
