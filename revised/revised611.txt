Question:
I have a Rock-ola jukebox with a Shure cartridge M44MR. I don't see that one on your replacement list. What stylus will fit this? Also, what replacement cartridge should be used?

Answer:

	The M44MR has been discontinued for many years as has the direct replacement stylus. We believe the current N44C stylus will fit your cartridge.
	
	Regarding a new cartridge, "Which phono cartridge will fit my turntable?".
