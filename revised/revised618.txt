Question:
I see you have one question on a Dual 1218 turntable for a stylus choice..but I don't know if my Dual 1219 is the same....I'm trying to find the Shure cartridge and stylus part numbers for a Dual 1219 turntable....THANKS for your help!! It's been many years since I used it and now feel that need to hear the records again....I don't even have an old Shure cartridge to give me an idea...

Answer:

	Thank you for your inquiry concerning Shure phonograph products.
	
	We cant recommend cartridges for specific turntables, as we dont have specifications for turntables. Information on cartridge types.
