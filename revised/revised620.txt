Question:
I intend to buy your SM7B microphone to connect to my computer. When using a plug-in adapter to reduce its size for the sound card connection, will I lose response quality?


Answer:

	You will not lose any quality by going through a simple adapter. But, the output level of the SM7B may be too low in level for a typical sound card. You might have to boost the level using a transformer, such as the Shure A96F, a preamp, such as the Audio Buddy by M-Audio, or use a better out-board sound card such as the Sound Devices USB-Pre.
