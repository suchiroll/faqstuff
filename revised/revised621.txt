Question:
Further to viewing your website, I was wondering if you could advise me on modern replacements for the V15 IV, M97 HE and the TKS 380E audio cartridges and styli. I have a DUAL CS728Q single platter turntable with the Ultra Low Mass tonearm system.


Answer:

	TheM97xE will replace the first two cartridges that you mentioned. We do not have records of a TKS 380E cartridge.
