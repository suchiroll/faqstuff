Question:
I have a monitor connected to a regular speaker.  Does this make the monitor more sensitive therefore causing less gain before feedback? What is the correct way to hook up a monitor.  I have a mixer going into the amp and from there the speakers are hooked up.

By the way, do all mixers(including non-powered mixers) have an on/off switch.

Answer:

	Shure does not manufacturer loudspeaker monitors. Therefore, we have no expertise in this area.

	As to your second question, all professional mixers have an on/off switch.
