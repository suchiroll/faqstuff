Question:
I have a Hitachi direct drive turntable model HY-202.  I have been using a Shure cartridge MT205P.  What is the current replacement, what is the cost, and how do I get one?  It's a direct plug in with a cross screw holding it in, no wiring to be done.

Answer:

	Thank you for your inquiry concerning Shure phonograph products. It sounds like you have a P-mount cartridge.
	
	As it is an impossible task to keep specifications on every turntable manufactured in the world, we cannot offer specific cartridge recommendations based on the turntable model. So to find a compatible phono cartridge for your turntable, click here.
