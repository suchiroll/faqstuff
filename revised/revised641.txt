Question:
How do I connect a Shure MX418D to a Shure bodypack?

Answer:

	The MX418D requires phantom power to operate. Phantom is defined as 11 to 52 volts DC and delivered on a balanced line. Shure bodypacks provide 5 volts DC of bias delivered on an unbalanced line. Therefore, a direct connection will not work. (Beware - some wireless mic manufacturers claim their transmitters provide phantom power, when they mean bias.)
	
	Here are two options:
	
	1. Install a battery operated phantom supply between the MX418D and the wireless bodypack.
	
	2. Use the ULXD8 with the MX415 instead.
