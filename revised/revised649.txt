Question:
Maybe I'm at the wrong forum for this quesion but I'll ask anyway. I would like to have a room in my basement dedicated to recording. Do you know of any good books or internet sites that deal with this subject? I mostly want to know with what should I insulate the walls and ceiling (and floor?) to have the best environment for live recording? Thanks.
