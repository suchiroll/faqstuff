Question:
I have a new Technics SL-1200Mk2 turntable. I previously used a M95ED cartridge on a Dual manual turntable. I would like to purchase a new cartridge for the new turntable and am considering the M97xE and the M92E. I want to have, at the very least, the same sound quality as before. Which do you recommend and what are the differences in the sound between the two cartridges I'm considering?


Answer:

	We suggest the M97xE. It is a big improvement over the M95ED and better than the M92E. For the price, the M97xE offers performance that is hard to beat.
