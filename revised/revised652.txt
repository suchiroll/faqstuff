Question:
I am looking for the best quality hand held and or headset system. I run a 12,000 seat multipurpose sports complex at the University of Hawaii. I am looking for a product used primarily for pregame, timeouts and halftime promotions.

Answer:

	We suggest you consider the UHF-R Series wireless. It is the top of the Shure wireless line and has many professional features you will find useful in a sports complex.
