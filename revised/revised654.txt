Question:
I am shopping for a friend who is a local DJ. He does a lot of private events where the crowd could be up to 200-300 people.  I am looking for a reasonably priced wireless microphone to go with his DJ equipment, something that has at least 300 feet of range.

Could you please recommend couple of your products?

Answer:

	We suggest the BLX Series.
	
	Also, please read the following booklet about wireless:

	TIP: Most DJs find significant performance improvements (less dropouts)by placing the wireless mic receiver up on top of their loudspeaker.
