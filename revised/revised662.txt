Question:
I'm an avid phonographic fan. I have a collection of Turntables Ranging from a 1940's Collaro and a Garrard to a mid 80's Technics SL-5 and AKAI APB 20C. The replacement styli for the former two are not clear and I have replaced them with two commonly available cartridges and they work fine.

For the Technics Player the Replacement Stylus is EPS-24CS
For the Akai Player the Replacement Stylus is AKAI RS-90

Can you please tell me whether I can replace them with some matching SHURE Magnetic Styli so that I can go on for a long time without changing the Stylus?

Usually with a SHURE Stylus how long can you go on without a change provided you take care of them as specified?   ( In years or sides of Records)

What will be the Cost of matching SHURE Stylus?

Answer:

	Thank you for your inquiry concerning Shure phonograph products.
	
	Shure styli will only fit Shure cartridges. So we cannot recommend a substitute Shure stylus for either of your cartridges. You might consider replacing your existing cartridges with Shure product.
