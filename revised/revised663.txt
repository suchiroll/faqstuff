Question:
I have a BSR 150SX Direct Drive Turntable that is missing the end off the arm that holds the stylus. Looking into the end of the arm there are four male pins arranged at 11, 1, 5 and 7 o'clock positions. In additions there are three female connections at 6, center, and 3 o'clock positions. Any idea as to where I might purchase one, or a substitute, to put my turntable back into working condition? I have been unable to locate BSR.


Answer:

	BSR went out of business long ago, and Shure does not keep technical data on turntables. However, here is information that may help you.
	
	Unless your turntable is a very inexpensive one, the cartridge mount will be one of the following two types:
	
	1) Standard Mount - by far the most common
	Two screws, half an inch apart, thread through the cartridge body to secure it to the headshell, which then plugs into the tone arm.
	
	2) P-mount - Primarily on Technics brand turntables
	The four prongs at the back of the cartridge plug directly into the tone arm. A set screw goes through the side of the cartridge at the back, to hold it in place on the tone arm.
	
	In descending levels of sound quality, we have the following cartridges available for listening to LPs:
	
	Cartridge - Application - Mounting type
	M97xE - audiophile - standard
	M92E - versatility - both
	M78S - 78 RPM - standard
	
	Monophonic cartridge for playing wide-groove / 78 RPM records: M78S
	
	The N78S replacement stylus will work in any of the above cartridges, providing them with wide-groove / 78 RPM record playback capability.
	
	All DJ cartridges are standard mount, but these are not recommended for home audio use.
