Question:
A few years ago I bought a cartridge for my record player. Recently I have tried to use it. I'm told to set the needle balance. I need instructions from the cartridge manufacturer. On the side of the cartridge it says "RXP3". It would be awesome if you could tell me how to set the balance correctly.

Answer:

	The RXP3 requires a tracking force of 1 to 1.5 grams. We suggest the use of a Shure SFG-2 stylus force gauge to measure the tracking force. Consult your turntable instructions on how to adjust the tracking force.
