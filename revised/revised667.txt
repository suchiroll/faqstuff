Question:
I am using the V-15 type III L-M for a long time now but the stylus definitely needs replacement. Is that still available ? If not, what is an good alternative for this combination ? I have an Dual CS-704 turntable.

Answer:

	Sorry, we no longer have replacement styli for this cartridge.
	
	All available stylus can be seen at the following web page: Discontinued Stylus Cross Reference

	
	If you wish to replace the cartridge, the M97xE is recommended.
