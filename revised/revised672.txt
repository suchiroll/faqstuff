Question:
I'm looking to purchase a new microphone for home karaoke use, which is a higher quality product, the BG 3.1 or the SM48? Which would you suggest for this purpose?


Answer:

	These two models are very similar in quality and performance. We suggest you audition both with your voice and purchase whichever sounds better to you. If they sound the same to you, purchase the one that looks better to you.
