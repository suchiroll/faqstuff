Question:
I have a Shure R25XT cartridge and a Shure 3X stylus.  The stylus needs to be replaced, but it seems that the replacement styli for the R25XT aren't in production.  Do you have any suggestions as to what I can do about getting a new stylus?

Answer:

	The N75B Type 2 stylus will likely fit the R25XT cartridge. To purchase, call Shure Parts at 800-516-2525.
