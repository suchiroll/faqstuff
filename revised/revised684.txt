Question:
I recently ordered your uhf wireless headset mic system from the dealer I go through. With that system I added a wireless SM58 handheld mic on the same frequency so I have the flexibility to use one or the other as needed. They came in with different frequencies and I'm wondering if the company made a mistake or if the frequencies don't have to be exact in order for the receiver to recognize both transmitters. The 2 different frequencies. are very close, one is 600.500mhz(approx) and the other is just around 596.000(approx).


Answer:

	To do what you suggest, the two transmitters must be on the exact same frequency. Return to the Shure dealer and request a new handheld transmitter on the exact frequency of your receiver.
