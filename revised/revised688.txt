Question:
Hello. I have a 4-piece band that is looking at the PSM400. My question: can a single transmitter be used with 4 receivers without any of the personal mixers? The mixer is nice but we really don't need individual monitor mixes at this point in time. If it's a required piece of the technology, that's different but, if not it would be unnecessary additional cost for us.


Answer:

	Yes, a single transmitter can be used with 4 receivers. The mixer is not required.
	
	For your application, you would need to order the components separately as follows:
	
	One - P4T Transmitter
	Four - P4R Receivers
	Four - E1 Earpieces
