Title: Changing Wireless Frequencies
Id: 690
Legacy Id: 707

Question:
I have a Marcad Diversity/Shure guitar and microphone wireless system that have the same exact frequency (192.200). Can one of these be changed?  I had never tried to use them at the same time before, but when I did, it didn't work. Please help me.

Answer:

	For older single frequency wireless systems, the following company might be able to change the frequency:
	
	Delta Audio
	7054 N Clark St
	Chicago IL 60626
	877-764-3634
	773-764-3634
