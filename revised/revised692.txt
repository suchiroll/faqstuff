Question:
At one time, Shure furnished a stylus microscope to dealers. Do you still have any for sale in new/or used condition. In the alternative, can you advise if you have a dealer that has one they would sell?


Answer:

	We do not have inventory of the MKE-1 or MKE-2 stylus evaluation kits.
	
	The microscope that came with the stylus evaluation kits was a model M240, manufactured by Swift Instruments.
