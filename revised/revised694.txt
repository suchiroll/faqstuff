Question:
My T1 Presenter transmitter is at least 5 years old.  It does not have the detachable cord.  I need a new tie clip for the very small wire.  What one do I need? 

Answer:

	The T1P came with the WL93 microphone. The WL93 tie clips are packaged as a set of 4 with part #RK354SB. The RK354SB can be ordered from our Parts Department at 800-516-2525 or 847-600-8699.
