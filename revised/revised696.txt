Question:
I own a pair of M44-G cartridges.  I bought the N44-7 stylus' to replace the used up needles.  Will it affect my records or cartridge or do I need to buy the needles meant for the M44-G's ??

Answer:

	The N44-7 replacement stylus tracks at 1.5 to 3 grams. The N44-G stylus tracks at 0.75 to 1.5 grams. There will be more wear on your records when using a heavier tracking force.
