Question:
Where can I get a stereo dynetic cartridge "M295ED" for my Pioneer PL-516 turntable?


Answer:

	The M295ED is discontinued. To help you find a suitable replacement, please read the following.
	
	Unless your turntable is a very inexpensive one, the cartridge mount will be one of the following two types:
	
	1) Standard Mount - by far the most common
	Two screws, half an inch apart, thread through the cartridge body to secure it to the headshell, which then plugs into the tone arm.
	
	2) P-mount - Primarily on Technics brand turntables
	The four prongs at the back of the cartridge plug directly into the tone arm. A set screw goes through the side of the cartridge at the back, to hold it in place on the tone arm.
	
	In descending levels of sound quality, we have the following cartridges available for listening to LPs:
	
	Cartridge - Application - Mounting type
	M97XE - audiophile - standard
	M92E - versatility - both
	M78S - 78 RPM - standard
	
	Monophonic cartridge for playing wide-groove / 78 RPM records: M78S
	
	The N78S replacement stylus will work in any of the above cartridges, providing them with wide-groove / 78 RPM record playback capability.
	
	All DJ cartridges are standard mount, but these are not recommended for home audio use.
