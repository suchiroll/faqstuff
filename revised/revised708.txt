Question:
The ac cord is missing on my VA 300-C. Where should a replacement be connected?

Answer:

	Yours is a strange question as the AC cord on the VA300C is permanently attached. It cannot be lost, only cut off.
	
	On the rear panel, directly to the left of the AC fuse, is a cable restraint grommet. The AC cable enters the VA300C at this point. Replacing this cable is a job for a professional electronics technician.
