Question:
I would like to know if I can use UC transmitters with U4D receivers

Answer:

	If they use the same frequency range, then they will work fine together. The frequency range is indicated by a two letter code similar to UA or UB. Just put the transmitter and receiver on the same frequency, and it will work.
