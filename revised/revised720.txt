Question:
I used one of these back in the early 80's for miking drums. This would allow me to still control signal strength going to the console without taking up 4 channels. Do you still make this or what do you advise?

Answer:

	Yes, Shure does make such a sub-mixer. Check out the Shure SCM268 mixer.
