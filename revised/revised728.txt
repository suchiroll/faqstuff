Question:
I seem to remember seeing that the UHF wireless system has an audio frequency range of 20 to 15,000 Hz.  Is this correct?  Does any system go up to 18,000Hz?

It would be extremely helpful if your comparison page gave the (audio) frequency response for each of your wireless systems.  :)

Answer:

	Due to the frequency modulation scheme that wireless systems use, the frequency response is limited to 50 to 15,000 Hz.
	
	The Audio Frequency Range is listed in either the User Guide or User Guide Supplement of all of our wireless systems.
