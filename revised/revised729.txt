Question:
I have an SCM268 that has been used as a table top unit for some time.  If I decide to rack mount it is there a kit available for this?

Answer:

	The SCM268 comes with all of the rack hardware needed. If you have lost the original rack hardware, you can order new ones from our Parts Department at 800-516-2525.
	
	You would need to order one piece of each of the following:
