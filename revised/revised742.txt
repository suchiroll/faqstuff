Question:
I am a very satisfied SHURE customer for many years now, and recently bought a WL183 microphone, intending to use it with a SAMSON CT-4L body pack transmitter. The problem is that the WL183 uses a 4-pin connector (TA4F) and the transmitter can handle a 3-pin connector (TA3F). Is there any way that this can be re-wired?


Answer:

	When you take apart the connector for the WL183, you will see the following scheme:
	
	Red wire - 5 volts bias
	Black wire - audio
	Shield - ground
	
	We do not know the input scheme of the Samson transmitter. Contact Samson to find out what pin serves which function on their transmitter.
	
	More information:
	What is the pin-out for Shure bodypack transmitters?
