Question:
I have a model 890TT microphone that needs a new battery.  Are these still available and can I get them from a electronic parts house?  Any information that you can supply me with would be appreciated. 

Answer:

	The Shure part number for this battery is 80A455. As of March 2001, Shure Parts has this item in stock. Call 800-516-2525 to purchase this battery.
