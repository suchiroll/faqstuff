Question:
When you put tape around the 1/8 inch screen, just below the writing. Does it change the pattern of the microphone?


Answer:

	This will alter the polar pattern in a very negative manner. The pattern will be become "semi-omnidirectional" and the frequency response will become very rough and irregular. Placing tape on a directional microphone will always cause problems if the tape covers any acoutical opening, grill, or port.
	
	Tape placed on the solid portion of a microphone handle is fine. This is often done for identification purposes.
