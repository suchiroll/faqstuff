Question:
Do you sell microphones for violins? What would you suggest?


Answer:

	Before you make any buying decision, we suggest that you read several booklets on miking musical instruments:
	Educational Articles - Online booklets and bulletins

	These books will acquaint you with the different types of microphones and the different types of miking techniques. With that information, you will be able to make a wise buying decision. As a general rule, a violin sounds best when miked with a condenser model with a flat response.
