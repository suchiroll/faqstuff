Question:
I have Technics SL-2000 direct drive turntable. Mounting of cartridge to turntable is "P-mount". Cartridge body to tone arm head is "standard attachment" with center screw through top of tone arm head. The cartridge body is black, with a silver logo imprint on stylus protector, reading:"Super Track Plus". Is there a replacement cartridge for this venerable, but reliable model that has served me well all these years?

Answer:

	The P mount concept has fell out of favor. Therefore, very few cartridges are still available. The best one now offered by Shure is the M92E.
