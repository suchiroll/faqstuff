Title: Frequency response of wireless monitors
Id: 760
Legacy Id: 780

Question:
I could only find a frequency response specification for the wired personal monitors. What is the frequency response for the P4R Wireless Receiver and the two types of earphones available?

The application is for a small amateur band that doesn't move around on stage very much.

Answer:

	The wireless system, without earpieces, has a frequency response of 50-15,000 Hz. The frequency response of the earpieces is going to depend on the shape of the users ear canal. Therefore, the frequency response of the earpieces cannot be specified.
