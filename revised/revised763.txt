Title: Output of mixer into T Series Body Pack Transmitter

Question:
I was wondering if I can connect the output (either headphone or monitor) from my mixer directly to the 1/4 " input on the body pack of my Shure body pack for my Shure Diversity wireless headset system. I have an application to do an outdoor event at a local high school stadium and would like to be able to tie my system into their sound system to help fill in the whole area with sound.


Second question is the body pack on the guitarist system to same as for the headset system?


Answer:

	The 1/4 plug is only available in T-series headset and guitar systems.
	
	The input of the transmitter is looking for a microphone level signal. You have to attenuate the signal going into the transmitter. Or keep the volume level real low out of the mixer headphone jack.
	
	Put the transmitter and antenna so that they are line of sight for the receiver.
	
	In the Shure T Series VHF Wireless line, the body pack transmitter for the Guitarist Model and the Headset Model is the same product. We assume it is the T Series to which you refer.
