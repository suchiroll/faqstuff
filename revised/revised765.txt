Question:
I would like to know if I can order a new transformer for my SM58 microphone, because the wires came out and I need a new wired transformer to fix it thanks.


Answer:

	Sorry, the internal transformer for the SM58 is held in place with epoxy and therefore cannot be removed or replaced. Call Shure Service at 800-516-2525 for more information on repairing your SM58.
