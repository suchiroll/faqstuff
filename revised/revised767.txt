Answer:

	At 03/20/2001 10:14 AM we wrote - We do offer 3 different dual receivers, the T88, the LX88, and the UHF Series. Realize, though, that systems are simply 2 receivers placed in the same physical box. The T88 and LX88 are non-diversity systems, so you should expect an occasional dropout when using these two systems.
	
	We recommend that you look at 2 separate systems, such as the diversity T series or diversity LX series.
