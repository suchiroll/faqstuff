Title: V15 type V MR - replacing the stylus
Id: 771
Legacy Id: 793

Question:
I need to replace the stylus as the cantilever was bent during our move.  I was told that since it is so "old" that the magnets will be so weak I would be better to replace the whole cartridge since the replacement stylus is now up to $160.00 street price. 

Is this magnet weakening issue real, or more of a dealer wanting to sell me up (in his opinion)?

Answer:

	Replacing the stylus also replaces the magnet. With a new stylus, your V15V-MR will be restored to like new condition. There is no need to replace the cartridge body. We will withhold comment on the dealers technical advice to you.
	
	Shure no longer has inventory of the VN5MR stylus.
	
	Here is a link for a replacement stylus not made by Shure. It has not been tested by Shure:
