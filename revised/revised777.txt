3) What are it's dimensions?

Answer:

	1) When properly positioned, the PS-6 will provide between 20 and 30 dB of pop reduction.
	
	2) From PS-6 fabric screen to performers lips: 1 inch (3 cm) maximum. From microphone to PS-6 fabric screen: 3 inches (8 cm) minimum. Also the PS-6 should be positioned 1 inch (3 cm) off-center from the center of the microphones grille.

	From 20 Hz to 4 kHz, the PS-6 has no effect.
	From 4 kHz to 6 kHz, the PS-6 has less than 1 dB of effect.
	From 6 kHz to 8 kHz, the response is down by 1.5 dB.
	From 8 kHz to 9 kHz, the response is down by 3 dB.
	From 9 kHz to 13 kHz, the response is down 1 dB.
	From 13 kHz to 20 kHz, the PS-6 has less than 1 dB of effect.
