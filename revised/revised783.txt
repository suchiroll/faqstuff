Question:
I have two questions regarding the A96F Impedance Transformer. 

1) Is the 3.5 mm plug ring-tipped (stereo)? 
2) A picture shows two cables from transformer to plug. Is one cable the hot (or +) lead and the other ground and cold ( or -) tied ? 

Thanks.

Answer:

	1) The 3.5 mm plug is stereo: tip, ring, sleeve. Tip and ring are connected together.
	2) There is a single conductor, shielded cable between the transformer and the plug. The inner conductor carries the audio, while the shield acts as both shield and ground.
