Question:
I am interested in using the E1 and/or E5 in a wired in ear monitor application.  Are these units compatible with standard headphone amplifiers?

Answer:

	Yes, you can certainly use the E1 or E5 with a standard headphone amplifier. The E1 and E5 are much more sensitive than most headphones, so you will not need to turn up the headphone amplifier as much.
