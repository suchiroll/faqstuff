Question:
I am a saxophone player who currently uses the SC wireless system with a SM98 mic. I'm wondering if the new Beta 98 capsule is compatible with this system. Would I notice a difference?


Answer:

	The Beta 98 will work into the SC bodypack. With the caliber of sound systems that you use, you will probably hear a difference. Will you like the Beta 98 better than the SM98? Only your ears can decide that, but we have had many saxophone players who prefer the sound of the Beta 98 when compared to the SM98.
