Question:
Since the PSM400 system uses the Group 1 frequencies of the PSM700, can you use P4Rs with P7Ts if you use them in MixMode with one channel going to the P4Rs and the other going to the P7Rs?

Answer:

	Yes, the P4R receivers will work with the P7T transmitter if they are in the same frequency band. The MixMode concept you described will work as well.
