Title: Repair of UT system

Question:
Hi, yesterday I purchased a "UT" series handheld wireless system.  It was the last one that the store had, so I took it.  When I got home I noticed that the transmitter has a small crack in it where it attaches to the microphone head.  I can't return the whole system because they don't have any more, and I can't just get a new transmitter because then the frequency's wouldn't match.  Is there any way I can get a replacement through the company?  Please help me out in any way you can.  Thanks.
