Title: Boom for 55SH

Question:
I recently purchased a 55SH for that classic look. A very attractive mic. It did not occur to me at the time that I would need a boom stand as I play guitar. I have seen some vintage looking booms used in conjunction with this mic, but have never been able to find one for sale, new or used. I know this may be beyond the scope of the Shure product line, but can you identify this model for me? I hate to ruin the classic vibe of this mic with a typical looking boom stand. Thanks


Answer:

	We are not certain what you mean by vintage looking boom stand. Atlas Sound has been essentially selling the same microphone stands for 40 years.
