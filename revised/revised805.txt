Title: Prologue 14L
Id: 805
Legacy Id: 827

Question:
Recently purchased this microphone at a local store for $30.00 Canadian. It's in excellent condition. What is the original selling price? When the 14L was revised to the 14A, was it just a change in name only, or were there changes to the specifications? If so, where can I get the specs on the 14L that I have?
thanks.

Answer:

	The Prologue 14L had a suggested U.S. retail price of $59.75 as of 1997, that was the last year of manufacture.
	
	The 14A was a complete redesign of the microphone cartridge and grille. Shure dropped the Prologue name at the time also.
