Question:
I was wondering if it is possible to order a replacement wind screen for a Shure model SM58 wired microphone.

	The part you are looking for is a replacement grill, model RK143G. The foam insert is not sold seperately. Replacement grills can be purchased from our Parts Department at 800-516-2525.
