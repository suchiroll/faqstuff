Title: UHF Antennas - 1/4 wave vs. 1/2 wave
Id: 810
Legacy Id: 832

Question:
Why is the 1/2 wave antenna UA820 available in a "UA" version and a "UB" version, but the 1/4 wave antenna UA400 isn't? Why doesn't it matter?


Answer:

	The 1/4 wave antenna (UA400) has a broader frequency range than the 1/2 wave antenna (UA820), and therefore can be used for the UC systems in the UA band and UB band. However, the 1/4 wave antenna is not as efficient as a 1/2 wave antenna tuned to a narrower band, and will likely be 3 to 5 dB less sensitive. This sensitivity difference might be a problem only when operating the UC wireless system at the maximum end of the transmission range, i.e., over 200 feet.
