Question:
I'm doing an interactive theater show and am in need of wireless headset microphones. I came across your SHURE UC14/20 UHF WIRELESS HEADSET MICROPHONE and wondered if this model could handle my need of musical vocal presentation. Please respond with a conformation or suggestions.


Answer:

	The UC system should be a fine choice. We suggest you audition it at a local Shure dealer as the sound of the WH20 mic may or may not meet your requirements. The selection of a mic is a personal choice and your ears must be the final judge.
	
	Other headworn mics to consider: WCM16; WBH53B (recently introduced).
