Question:
I have a client who owns an AKG wireless system. It comprises of a SR-61 receiver and a PT-61 belt pack transmitter. The microphone that comes with it needed to be replaced and my colleague has convinced him on a Shure WL184.

I am hoping you can advise me on the correct pin configuration for the mic to be integrated to the wireless system. I have tried several myself and it didn't work very well. The AKG transmitter comes with a 3-pin "mini-xlr". The only info I have on the beltpack's input: << Pin1: gnd, Pin2: audio in, Pin3: +bias(7volts via internal resistor of about 7.6 kohms) condenser mics requires pins 2 & 3 to be linked>>

Certainly hope you can help in the above. I suspect that I may need an optional item to match the impedances or supply the phantom power. Do point me in the right direction.

Answer:

	Here is our suggestion based on the information you supplied on the AKG unit:
	
	WL184 shield wire to AKG pin 1
	WL184 black wire to AKG pin 2
	WL184 red wire to AKG pin 3
	
	You should require no additional items.
