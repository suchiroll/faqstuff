Title: headset for house of worship
Id: 815

Question:
Our minister is open to using a headset microphone now. We have a challenge with feedback/gain in our sanctuary (The speakers are hung left and right above podium).


I see you have a new Beta headworn. What microphone would you recommend.


Answer:

	The Beta 53 would be a great one to audition. It is very lightweight, very comfortable, and very low profile. But you must try it in the acoustics of your church to see if it meets the needs of your minister.
	
	The MX153 would also be a good choice, as it is very small and unobtrusive.
