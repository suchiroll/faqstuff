Title: T Series transmitter replacement parts

Question:
I have a Shure T4V Diversity wireless receiver with a T2 Vocal Artist transmitter equipped with an SM58 mic element.  I love it!  

My problem is this.  On the transmitter, the plastic barrel in the mid section of the mic that houses the switches, electronics, etc is cracked (at the mic element end).  I am not concerned with the aesthetics as much as the fact that the insides have shifted and I cannot reliably turn power on.  Is this part of the mic available for replacement?  I am technical enough to repair the mic if I can get the plastic part.  To further clarify the part I need,   The battery cover screws into the bottom and the mic element screws into the top.

I want to have this mic repaired and in use by April 3 so please respond as soon as you can.
