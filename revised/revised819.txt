Question:
i resently purchased a axsgwd wireless for my warwick thumb bolt-on bass. If i play lightly it works fine, but if i play hard it cuts out for a second leading me to believe my bass is too hot and i need to adjust the input sensitivity somewhere. i don't have a manual, so i'd appreciate any help you could give me. thank you.

	If the reciever Audio overload light is coming on when you play hard, then yes, it means that you are overloading the transmitter/receiver. There is a page in the users guide that talks about lowering the gain or volume level coming out of the transmitter.
	
	The user guide which is in a pdf format is attached to this message. Just follow the directions.
