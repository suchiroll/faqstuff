Question:
I have a customer that would like to purchase a WCM16 with A120S and a Male XLR connection. Please reply as soon as you can. 

Answer:

	If your customer wants to use the WCM16 wired, they can use the RK100PK preamp.
	
	The A120S will not work on this microphone. Its a condenser microphone.
