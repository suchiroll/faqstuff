Question:
My supplier advised that above choir mic has been discontinued.
Reference to your web site confirms in that it is not listed along with the cardioids.

This shatters my plans for ambience recording of  our two organs.
Can you provide two omnis on special order?  Can recommend an omni that could be used for the purpose?

Answer:

	Because Shure did not sell very many of the omnidirectional versions of the MX202, the marketing department decided to drop that model number.
	
	Order the MX202B/N and the R183B Omnidirectional cartridge to get the equivalent of the MX202B/O.
