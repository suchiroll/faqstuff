Question:
I need to buy a piano mic for sound re-enforcement purposes and it has to be mounted inside the piano, can you please suggest one for a Grand Piano and one for an Up-right Piano. Thanks in advance!


Answer:

	For mounting inside a piano, the best choice is a boundary microphone attached to the underside of the piano lid. The Shure microphone designed for this application is the Beta 91A, a cardioid pattern, condenser, boundary microphone. This microphone will work for both a grand and upright piano.
