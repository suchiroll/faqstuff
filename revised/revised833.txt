Question:
I have a Dual 1019 turntable in which I have, for years, been using an Empire cartridge labeled 3000 ME/X and an Empire 999VE before that. Could you please tell me which, if any, of your cartridges can be used in my Dual 1019? It is a good machine, and I don't want to replace it if I can avoid it.
