Question:
Where can I obtain parts for shure 55SW? I need a new internal wind screen and cartridge shock mounts.


Answer:

	The 55SW has been discontinued for over 25 years. Shure no longer has replacement parts. We suggest you contact collectors of old microphones. As a start, try: Toms Mics
