Question:
Are there any manuals available for the Shure C/PEK-3 stereo cartridge analyzer? I have found a used one, and would be interested in purchasing manuals or test LP's for it.


Do the original Shure TTR-117 test records work with the C/PEK-3 analyzer?


Answer:

	Provide us your mailing address and we will send a manual.
	
	The test records supplied with the C/PEK-3 were: TTR 103 and TTR 107. The 107 specifically tested for output level and channel crosstalk. We have never tried the TTR 117 with the C/PEK-3.
