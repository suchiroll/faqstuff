Id: 855

Question:
I recently re-discovered my old Shure model 61. I am a professional musician, and have been for the past 35yrs.(Boy am I tired!). Anyway, my question is, can I send it to you for repair? I would love to have this working again. Please let me know.


Answer:

	Sorry, Shure Service no longer has repair parts for the SM61. The SM61 was discontinued in 1984.
