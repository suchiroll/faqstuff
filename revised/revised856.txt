Question:
I have been using KSM32's quite successfully in ORTF configuration for classical orchestra recording.  Am intrigued with possibility of using KSM32 for mid and KSM44 as side in M-S configuration.  How do you feel about match? Has it been tried?

Answer:

	While the sound of the mics are very similar, the KSM44 is 5 dB quieter than the KSM32. This may be noticeable in a critical recording situation.
	
	No one at Shure has tried the KSM32/KSM44 combination for M-S. A better choice would be two KSM44 mics for the M-S configuration.
