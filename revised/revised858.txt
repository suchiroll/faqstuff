Question:
Hi guys: I've been trying to get/buy a claw or clamp to clamp/hold a mic ( not wireless ) to the guitar amplifiers and snare, toms, kick, etc..., to not to use tripod stands or other stands to microphone the guitar amps and the drums. I've seen such clamps/claws, but can not find them locally. Please guide me where to buy them on the internet, or if you have them, where should I look.

Answer:

	Look at the Shure A56D
