Question:
I just called and was sent an application note titled "Controlling a DFR11EQ Using a Modem". The tech I talked to told me that I could only recall presets but the application note says that full control is possible. Which is correct? In addition, is it possible to control a network of DFR11EQ's or even two through one modem connection?


Answer:

	When using a remote modem, you will have full control of the DFR11EQ. You will also be able to control a complete network of DFRs, i.e. up to 16.
