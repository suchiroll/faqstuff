Question:
I currently have the Shure UT receiver with the SM58 Mic, I would like to know if the Shure Lavalier Clip Mic will work with the same receiver.


Answer:

	Yes, it will work as long as the the UT bodypack transmitter has the same frequency as the UT handheld transmitter. Also, you can only use one transmitter at a time.
