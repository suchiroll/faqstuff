Question:
I was wondering if "frequency synthesized" in the UHF systems means that they are PCM encoded?

Answer:

	Frequency synthesized means the operating frequency is not controlled by a crystal, but synthesized by an electronic circuit, typically a Phased Locked Loop (PLL) circuit. It has no relationship to PCM encoding.
