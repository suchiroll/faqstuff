Title: N75C Stylus

Question:
I am in need of an acceptable replacement for a Shure M75CS Cartridge as it appears to no longer be available. My grandson broke off the stylus. This cartridge is used in a BSR McDonald 510 automatic turntable which is a component of a Heathkit Compact Stereo Center Model AD-27A that I assembled around 1968 -1970. Needless to say there is sentimental value involved here.

I really only need the stylus (.0006" spherical diamond, Shure N75C) but I am not sure I can get that without buying the whole cartridge. The phono cartridge has a tracking pressure of 3 to 5 grams.

If you have an idea for a replacement please let me know where I can buy or order it from. Thank you.

Answer:

	The N75-6 stylus is available from Shure Parts at 800-516-2525. It will fit the cartridge body M75CS.
	
	The N75-6 tracking range is 1.5 to 3 grams. Use the 3 gram setting on your tonearm.
	
	The N75C stylus is no longer available from Shure.
