Question:
I have a Technics Turntable model SL-10 (a linear tracking tonearm) and I would like to replace my stylus. The cartridge is a EPS-310MC, moving coil stereo cartridge, coreless twin-ring coil type (Pure boron pipe). Stylus tip has the following characteristics : 0.2 x 0.7 mil (4 x 18 um), Elliptical stylus, block diamond tip. I cannot find any equivalent number on you cross-reference guide. Can you tell me what is the best one for this cartridge. Thank you for your help.

Answer:

	Shure makes only moving magnet cartridges so if your turntable preamp will handle moving magnet cartridges, there are certainly a variety of choices.
	
	What phono cartridge will fit my turntable?
