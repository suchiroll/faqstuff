Question:
I've got a guitarist wireless system, and I have a Huge Problem!  I had a show 2 nights ago in Eastern WA, and lost the little plastic piece for the battery pack.  I've got a chunk of duct tape holding the battery in, but every time I jump, the battery looses contact, and therefore making me "clip" on stage.  I have been forced to use "cables" (how primitive, huh!), and I'm in a bind most of the time!  PLEASE HELP ME!!  I'll do anything to get a hold of a plastic piece to hold my battery in place!

Answer:

	Replacement parts, such as battery covers, can be purchased from our Parts Department by calling 800-516-2525 during normal office hours.
