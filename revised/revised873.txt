Title: Changing Frequencies of T series wireless
Id: 873
Legacy Id: 900

Question:
My church has purchased T Series wireless products and has the following question: Is it possible to change the operating frequency of the wireless microphones or base stations? What is the procedure to do this? The reason for this is another church has a similar system and it interferes with ours.


Can an authorized dealer do the same thing?


Answer:

	Our Service Department can change the frequencies for a nominal charge.
	
	In general, dealers do not have the test equipment, the training, nor the governmental license. It must be done at Shure.
