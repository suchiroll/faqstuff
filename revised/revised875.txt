Question:
I'm looking for a cover for your product FP42 audio mixer ; I know that Porta-Brace company is manufacturing specific covers for other Shure mixers FP33, ...), but not for FP42 which is bigger than the others.

Thank you to give me the reference of a manufacturer and product for a specific cover designed for FP42.


Answer:

	At one time Portabrace made a cover for a Nagra audio recorder that had similar dimensions to the FP42.
	
	The dimensions of the FP42 are 3 1/8 high and 12 7/32 wide and 9 1/16 in deep.
