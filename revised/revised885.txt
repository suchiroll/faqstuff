Question:
Please advise me on the price of the Vocal Artist hand held diversity system. Also,is this the top of the line for a professional vocalist?If not please advise me on what is the top of the line.

Answer:

	The Vocal Artist is an entry level system. We cannot recommend it for use on a ocean liner for many reasons.
	
	Top of the wireless line is the UR24D/KSM9 or UR24S/KSM9. It would be an excellent choice for your needs.
