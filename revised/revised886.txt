Question:
Hey, I'm in a punk / ska Christian band and we notice your mics have great quality.  We were wondering if you make a wireless clip on mic for trumpets in particular.  If not that, brass instruments?

Answer:

	Almost all of our wireless systems are offered with the Beta 98 horn microphone. This includes a clamp that will mount the Beta 98 to the bell of a horn.
