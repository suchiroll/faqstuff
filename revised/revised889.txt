Question:
Hi, I am mailing you with a question concerning the purchase of a microphone. I have talked to many people regarding the purchase of a new mic and everyone points me to Shure so I thought I would give your site a try and see what you have to offer.


Here's my situation: I'm in a band. We are lucky enough to be close enough to another band that we have all the equipment we need for shows. One thing we do not have, however, is a quality mic for recording at our makeshift studio at home. We need a mic that is good to record with but at the same time sufficient for use on the road. (Quality recording is priority) We are a small alternative band with only a local following, so money is the biggest issue.  I would like to stay under $200, or better yet $150. Any advice you can offer me would be much appreciated.


Answer:

	1) Regarding dynamic versus condensor, see:Microphone Techniques for Music - Studio Recording
	
	2) For recording, we recommend the PGA81 or SM137. If you are recording in stereo, use two of each model and mount them on the Shure A27M stereo mic holder.
	
	For ideas on how to record in stereo, see the above Studio Recording booklet.
