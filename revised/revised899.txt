Question:
Can you Daisy chain 4 P4M Mixers using the 4 individual mic in/out connections, then run the mic lines from the last P4M in the chain out to the House mixer thus allowing for 4 separate uninterrupted mixes going to 4 separate transmitters without any mic line loss at all???

Answer:

	There will some loss of the mic signal, typically less than 2 dB. This slight gain loss can easily be made up by the mixing console.
