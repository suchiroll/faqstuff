Question:
Will boosting high frequencies increase speech intelligibility?

Answer:

	Not necessarily. The majority of speech intelligibility for the human voice is centered in the 1-2 kHz range. Boosting frequencies above this range will increase sibilance, but will not necessarily improve intelligibility. -more information-
