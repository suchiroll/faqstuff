Question:
I have a Pentium 3 with what I suspect is a powered sound card and I need a microphone for computer voice recognition software with the following features:


1. excellent noise cancellation


2. an off/on switch


3. 10 ft cord


4. over the top of the headset with an adjustable microphone


5. ability to hear/playback what is recorded (ie. bidirectional features)


Are the HW501 or WH505 the correct mic's? If not which best meet the needs that I have listed?


Answer:

	The VR230D or the VR250BT would have all the features you have listed except one. The VR230D is a dynamic microphone. And the VR250BT is a condenser. Condenser computer microphone typically draw voltage from the sound card to operate. They have a higher output level than the dynamic microphones. Both have over-the-head style of headset. Return audio provided through a single, wide range earphone speaker.
	
	The only feature they do not have is an on/off switch.
	
	You can view the specifications for each of the microphones at these addresses.
	
	For the VR250BT
	
	For the VR230D
	
	You will also find information about pricing and ordering these microphones. These are the only microphones Shure sells directly.
