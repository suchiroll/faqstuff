Question:
I have one wireless (Shure) and need another. I was told to get a Shure UHF AXU 58D. I cannot find this model number anywhere. Is there such a model number on a current wireless microphone?

Thank you.


Answer:

	The Access UHF wireless series is sold to only Guitar Center stores. The Shure branded equivalent is the UT wireless series.
