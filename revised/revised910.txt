Question:
I was wondering how much this amp sold for new and roughly what is it's used price? I am considering buying one but I want to find out this information before I do. He wants $200 for it and it does work.

Answer:

	It was discontinued in 1980 and the last U.S. suggested retail price was $815.00. Since we are in the business of selling new gear, we do not keep track of the price of used gear.
