I am going to do slide presentations this summer in a small auditorium and I am looking for a system that will support two wireless transmitters (that the presenters use) as well as one mic to work with the audience. I would appreciate to hear any suggestions from you.

Thanks in advance.

I probably didn't state my question very clearly, but I am not looking for a portable sound system. I am more looking at something like your dual channel VHF wireless system. Or could I simply use two 'Presenter Systems'? I am actually looking for system that will allow for two wireless transmitters.

Thanks for your response.
