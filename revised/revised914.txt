Question:
In Shure nomenclature, is a "controlled magnetic" mic the same as a dynamic mic?



Answer:

	No. A controlled magnetic microphone is not the same as a dynamic microphone. In a dynamic element, the voice coil is attached to the diaphragm and moves within the magnetic field. In a controlled magnetic, the coil is stationary and the diaphragm moves a ferrous armature which disturbs the magnetic field and induces a signal in the coil.
