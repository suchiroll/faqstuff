Question:
I was wondering if Shure produces a podium/lectern system including an amplified speaker and a mic. I'm constantly setting up portable systems including a mixer, an amp, mic, mic stand, speaker, speaker stand, then all the wires and cables; all this stuff just for a mic for one person to talk to a group. It's just too much time and effort. I'd like to be able to just wheel in a podium plug it in and be done! If Shure has anything like that please let me know. If you don't would you mind pointing me in the right direction. I've got no leads as of yet. Please help!

Answer:

	Anchor Audio makes portable systems like you describe.
