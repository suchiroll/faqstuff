Question:
I recently bought a Samson UHF One wireless and I hate it! The problem is that the signal coming from my guitar (PRS Swamp Ash w/ McCarty Electronics) overdrives the input of the wireless. If I turn the gain down I lose so much signal that I can't use it. My question is would I have the same problem with the LX series wireless as I am having now??? I am looking for a wireless that SOUNDS like I'm using a cable!


Answer:

	Although, we try to make the wireless sound like a cable, there are inherent flaws in every wireless system. For example, a wireless system will have a smaller dynamic range than a cable. Blame physics and the Federal Communications Commission as both dictate how audio signals can be transmitted.
	
	Adjusting the gain control on the transmitter will help achieve the best possible performance from your wireless system. The gain control setup is described in the User Guide.
	
	If you feel that the wireless system affects the guitar tone too much, stick with a cable as a high quality cable is a better signal path than any wireless system (Shure or non-Shure).
