Question:
I own a "Realistic" LAB 320 turntable with a SHURE R25XT cartridge and SURE 5X stylus.  The stylus (at least) needs replacement but I see it is discontinued. What replacement Cartridge/Stylus assembly would you recommend? The tone arm has a Standard 2-screw mount.

Answer:

	Thank you for your inquiry concerning Shure phonograph products.
	
	As it is an impossible task to keep specifications on every turntable manufactured in the world, we cannot offer specific cartridge recommendations based on the turntable model. So to find a compatible phono cartridge for your turntable, click here.
