Question:
Please forgive my ignorance, but I am unable to get any signs of life from my microphone.

My "mixer" for the phantom power is a Korg digital 8 track machine. Could you see any reasons that I cannot get any response or tone from the microphone?

Answer:

	For the KSM32 to operate, the Korg must: 1) supply 48 volts of phantom; 2) have a female XLR connector as the mic input; 3) have a mic input that is balanced and low impedance. Check with Korg to make certain all these technical requirements are met.
