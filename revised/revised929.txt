Question:
I have a Beta 98 which I use with a bell mount for playing sax. I just bought a WM98 to be used with a Shure SC4 wireless system. My question is, can I use the Beta 98 mic on the WM98 cable? Is the Beta 98 mic a better mic than the WM98?


Answer:

	The Beta 98 should work using the SC wireless system, just like the WM98 works. Simply substitute one mic for the other.
	
	No, the Beta 98 is not better than the WM98. They are of equivalent quality, but they do sound slightly different
