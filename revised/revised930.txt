Title: Replacing WA302 guitar cable
Id: 930

Question:
I've had my wireless unit for my guitar for just under a year and it's looks like the WA302 inst. cable had gone bad. I've tried to fix it on the fly at a gig, but all I did was make it worse. What is the price of a replacement cable and how do I order one? I really like this unit and would like to get back to using it ASAP. Thank you.
