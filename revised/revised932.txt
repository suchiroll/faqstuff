Title: Replacements for stolen T Series wireless
Id: 932
Legacy Id: 960

Question:
I have a Shure T4V  diversity receiver-vocal.  Freq:208.2

The mike and power supply were stolen. Questions:

1. Can I use a T1G Body-Pack Transmitter for guitar with this unit?

2. Can I get a replacement PS20 power supply?

If the answer is yes to these questions, how would I go about getting these parts and what would be the cost?


Answer:

	1. Yes. Just order a T1G bodypack transmitter on the same frequency as the receiver. You can purchase this only through a Shure dealer. The T series has been discontinued, so it might be difficult finding a transmitter.
	
	2. Yes. You can buy this directly from Shure or order it through a dealer at the same time you order the bodypack.
