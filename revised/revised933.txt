Question:
We would appreciate to receive your advice what kind/type of microphone we should use for spoken word recorded in a studio as audio file to be broadcast later on shortwave radio.


As you may know, understandability is a major problem for broadcasting on shortwave (3-30 MHz) due to interference from different sources such as noise, fading, adjacent channel interference, etc.


If you are familiar with these kind of problems, then we would appreciate to receive your information about what microphone we use best in these circumstances.
