Title: Information on Model 51 microphone
Id: 935
Legacy Id: 963

Question:
I am wondering if there is anyone there that can help me.


I have just been going through my father's estate material and have become the recipient of his recording material.


One of the items is a "Shure Dynamic Microphone, Model 51 Multi-impedance microphone." There is no serial number but I believe he bought in the 1950s. It is quite heavy, has a 3-pin connection, is about 3 by 5 inches and about 2 inches deep with a grill on the face.


Can you tell me anything about it? Is it still a good mic? I have not tested it yet.


Any info appreciated.


Answer:

	This model was manufactured from 1947 to 1976.
