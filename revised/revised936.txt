Question:
I'm a long-time user of your UHF U4D system.  I'm using the Beta 87 handheld mic and am wondering whether or not I can use it w/any other Shure UHF receiver.  i.e. Can I program the mic to the UHF channel of, say your UC receiver or even one of your UT receivers?

Answer:

	The U2/Beta 87 microphone could be used with a UC receiver as long as the receiver was in the same frequency band as the transmitter. The frequency bands are UA or UB.
	
	The UC receiver does not have as many available frequencies as the U4 receivers do. Also the battery indicator on the receiver is not valid either.
	
	The U2/Beta 87 microphone cannot be used with the UT receiver.
