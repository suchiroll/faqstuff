Title: Doubling up on mixer inputs
Id: 937

Question:
Currently I have 4 mics into a 4 channel mixer and need to add 4 more mics on the same mixer.  I would probably use XLR 'Y' connectors to insert 2 mic cables into each input.

Although this probably isn't the best idea, can it be done???

How can I explain to a non-technical person (who controls the $$$) the need for a second mixer??

Answer:

	Please advise the model numbers of the Shure mics involved and the Shure mixer(s). Our answer will depend upon the models.
	
	In general, Ying two mics into one input has two shortcomings: 1) Each mic loads the other and the signal level to the mixer drops; 2) There is no way to control the level of each mic with an mixer input level control because each level control acts upon two mics, not one.
