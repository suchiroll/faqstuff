Question:
I'm a student & I really need your help. I have to submit a thesis regarding mics. It so happened that "polar patterns" was the topic assigned to me. Can you give at least an overview on how to make a supercardioid mic or any suggested reading material and where to avail them? I will really appreciate the info you will share with me. For as long as I know you were the best

Answer:

	We suggest you consult the book: Microphone Engineering Handbook; edited by Michael Gayford; Focal Press; ISBN 0-7506-1199-5. Also try: www.aes.org
