Question:
I already purchased several packages of stylus cleaners from the makers of DiscWasher. The package contains a bottle of cleaner solution and a small brush. Do you think that this is okay? Also, how often do you suggest that I clean the stylus?


Answer:

	Proper cleaning of the stylus should have no effect on the life of the stylus. The stylus shank is made of metal and the tip is a diamond. Neither are affected by denatured alcohol. Cleaning once a week would not be considered too much.
