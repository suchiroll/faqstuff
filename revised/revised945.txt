Question:
I am trying to find a replacement mixer for Church.  The old one was a Shure model M68, four mic inputs, one aux input - each with adjustable level and a master output control.  It was being used for the area of the music group to add more mics as necessary and control them in common.  I recently attended a seminar at a motel complex where I saw a unit looking suspiciously like it with a slightly newer look.  I believe it was a model M68FCA. I need to find a replacement.  Do you have a recommendation?

Answer:

	The SCM268 is a direct replacement.
