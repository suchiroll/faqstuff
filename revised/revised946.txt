Question:
How do I convert a balanced microphone signal to a balanced/unbalanced line level signal? Can I use the A15LA in reverse? If no such device exists, then what is the easiest, i.e. cheapest way to convert a balanced low impedance mic signal to an unbalanced 600 ohms (or higher) mic signal?

Answer:

	The A15LA cannot be used in reverse. You require a mic to line amplifier.
