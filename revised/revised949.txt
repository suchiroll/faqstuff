Question:
Is the new Beta 53 headset compatible as a wireless to the U4S dual system? Or can you recommend another receiver?


Answer:

	Yes.
	
	You can use it on any of our wireless bodypack transmitters except the T1G.
	
	There are two versions of the Beta 53 with the TA4F connector on them. One is black and the other is tan/beige. The black version is model number WBH53B and the tan version is model number WBH53T.
