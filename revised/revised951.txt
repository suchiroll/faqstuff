Question:
Can you suggest Shure wireless products for use around Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA.

I am interested in using a wireless with an accordion equipped with condenser mics.  Output jack of accordion is standard 1/4 inch.

Answer:

	Any of our systems are available as guitar systems that would have a 1/4 cable to go into the transmitter. These should work for you.
