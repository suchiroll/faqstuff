Have a requirement of a radio system for the rugby season in RSA, where the spectators can listen to the referee, the referee needs a noise canceling mic to reduce spectator noise, I have used the Sonic range of gear, but not too good.


Answer:

	We recommend using a headset microphone. This will provide the best direct versus ambient sound. The WH20 would be a good choice for your application. You can see the WH20 at the following link:
