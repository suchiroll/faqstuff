Question:
I just had a quick question. I currently own a Beta 58 wireless. I do love this mic. Aside from singing with the band I also DJ quite a bit. Is there a compatible bodypak that I can buy to be able to use a head set with the receiver that I already have, or do I have to buy a new headset altogether.


Answer:

	You can purchase a body pack and headset separately for any of our wireless systems. The Beta 58 microphone cartridge is offered on 4 of our wireless systems, so you will need to determine which wireless system you have. You can then purchase the bodypack and headset from your local Shure dealer.
	
	You will not be able to use the headset and the handheld at the same time. Only one transmitter can be on at any given moment.
