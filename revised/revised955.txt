Title: Replace an SM99
Id: 955

Question:
I have an SM99 microphone that we use in our pulpit in church that has a stress break in the arm.  Thus, it will no longer stand up on its own.  We'd like to get a replacement but I can't find this product in your catalog anymore.  Is this still available?  If not, can you suggest a substitute?

Answer:

	The SM99 was replaced with the MX412 and MX418. These are available in many different models with many choices of polar pattern.
	
	The MX412/S is the direct replacement, but you may want to consider the MX412/C cardioid version.
