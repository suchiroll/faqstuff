Question:
I would like to seek your expert technical advice on whether stylus VN45 (for V15 Type IV cartridge) could be installed in/or physically compatible with V15VxMR cartridge. I am not expecting a performance exactly the same as using VN5x stylus but wish to know whether a different tonal flavour could be achieved with such a combination.


Answer:

	Sorry, the VN45 will not fit in the V15VxMR.
