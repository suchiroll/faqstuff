Title: Shure Artist Endorsement
Id: 960

Question:
My band is wanting to obtain knowledge on Shure policies for endorsements. Although unsigned, we are extremely dedicated to our music. As you probably know, with playing shows, recording, promoting the band, buying merchandise, and constantly replenishing worn equipment, money is a serious consideration to the vitality of any band. With that, any help from your company would greatly be appreciated. It goes without saying that Shure products are my first and only choice, and if your company was to help me, I would do more than I already am to convince musicians that Shure does produce the best product.

I thank you in advance for you consideration of my inquiry. If there is anything I can provide you in the way of information (i.e. bio, demo, etc.) please do not hesitate to ask. Once again thank you, and I look forward to your reply.


Answer:

	Thank you for your interest in the Shure Artist Endorsement Program for the United States. To be considered for endorsement, please provide the following:

	
		Digital downloads of your most recent music (and videos if available)
	
		A current electronic press kit, which should include a bio and management contact information
	
		Links to your official website and social media sites
	
		A current tour schedule

		List of Shure products that you desire for endorsement


	Please submit all of the above via email to artistrelations@shure.com

	Due to the large volume of endorsement requests we receive, we are unable to respond to everyone; however, be assured that all requests are reviewed. If we see a good fit for our current endorser roster, then we will contact you with further details.
	
	Shure does not sponsor tours, management firms, booking agencies, producers, engineers, studios or labels.
