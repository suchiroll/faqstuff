Question:
I am trying to find out the input and output impedances of the PSM600 in-ear monitor systems.

How about output impedance from the belt pack to the actual ear piece itself. If I could also get that information, that would be great. I'm trying to use this in a specific theatre application and the wireless monitor system will work great. Thanks for your help--


Answer:

	The impedance of the XLR input connector is 20k ohms. The impedance of the 1/4 loop-through female phone jack is 20k ohms.
	
	At 04/11/2001 10:21 AM we wrote - The receiver audio output is designed to drive earphones that have an impedance of 16 ohms or greater.
