Question:
Will you please recommend a good shock absorbing desk mic stand for use with the Shure SM58 mic? Thank you.



Answer:

	Shock mounting an SM58 on a desk stand can be done a couple different ways.

	1) The discontinued S39A desk stand provided shock isolation between the table surface and the microphone stand adapter.

	2) The A55HM isolation mount fastens to a desk stand, like the Shure S37A.
