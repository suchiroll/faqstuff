Title: FP32A or FP33 Mix Bus cables
Id: 972

Question:
What is the output level of the Mix Bus jack of the FP32, FP32A, + FP33 mixers? Is it Line, Mic, or some other level?

Since it is only 3 wire I assume that it is Left, Right and Common. Am I correct? (And thus not shielded?)

Can I get an extra pair of Left and Right outputs from the mixer by making a cable that is 3 pin (Switchcraft TA3?) to two male XLR's? Can you please provide the pin wiring.

This is unrelated to the above question -
I have looked at the Shure web site before, but never the question and answer section. I am very impressed with the layout and content of the FAQ (Q+A) section of your site. It is a great service to the users of your equipment to have this service available to us. Thanks a lot!

Answer:

	Thank you for the compliment.
	
	Here is the answer to your question.
	
	Mix Bus Level = +4dBm nominal
	Mix Bus Z = 930 ohms
	
	Connector Outs:
	Pin 1 = left
	Pin 2 = right
	Pin 3 = ground/shield
	
	Looking at mixer jack
	Upper left = pin 1
	Upper right = pin 3
	Lower middle = pin 2
	
	The mix output is pre-Master gain control.
	
	If you want a manufactured device that meets your need, purchase the Bus-Mon from Peter Engh Audio; phone 612-827-7992. Peter is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.
