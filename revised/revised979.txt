Title: Shure Vocal Master PA speakers
Id: 979
Legacy Id: 1008

Question:
What is the impedance of the Shure Vocal Master column speaker?


The information printed on the rear sticker of one I'm working with says:


45739 300 OHM 1.25a hr190 4475


The Vocal Master PA head that goes with these speakers is toast. It is beyond repair, and has been checked out by a qualified, experienced bench tech here in St. Louis.


I want to advise the current owner what new amplifier to purchase.


In order to make a recommendation about a new power amp, I need to know the

impedance of each of the column speakers.


Can you please help?


Answer:

	The VA300-S has an impedance of 16 ohms. The VA301-S has an impedance of 32 ohms.
