Question:
I just acquired a 50's 55S and a 556 which have 1/4" plugs for connecting. I would like to rewire for XLR connections. Can you help me with this?


Answer:

	Depending on the year of 55S that you have, it will have either a 3 pin XLR connector or a 3 pin screw-on Amphenol connector. These are both wired the same way.
	
	Pin 1 - Ground
	Pin 2 - Audio +
	Pin 3 - Audio -

	The 556 came with a permenantly attached cable. To wire this for an XLR, connect the wire as follows:
	
	Shield - Pin 1
	Black - Pin 2
	White - Pin 3
