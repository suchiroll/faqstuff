Question:
I'm wondering if the FP33 can be powered by an adapted 12-14volt NP1 battery. I've heard yes but the 9v's must be in place and someone else said no it doesn't work. I need the Pro's answer.


Answer:

	The FP33 will accept any external DC source from 12-30 volts. The 9-volt batteries do not need to be in place if you are externally powering the FP33.
