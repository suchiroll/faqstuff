Question:
I am attempting to record acoustic guitar with a BG 4.0. I am using a Yamaha AW 4416 digital deck. I am getting a very low volume from the mic; I have tried phantom power (from the Yamaha) and also a battery in the mic, but with poor results from both. Any suggestions?


Answer:

	Yes, you likely require a microphone preamp. Try the Audio Buddy at www.m-audio.com. Or the M1b mic preamp from www.rane.com.
