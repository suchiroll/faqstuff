Question:
Hello, I would like to know if there is anyway to get different heads on the UT wireless handheld system instead of the UT2/58? And also if I change the microphone heads, will it cause any damage to the system whatsoever?


Answer:

	Any of our wireless heads can be used with the UT handheld without damage.
