Question:
1. Can you tell me what specific mic holder I can purchase to place my MX418 mics on a regular mic stand?


2. Also would like to change one of the MX418 mics to a supercardioid... I know I can purchase the capsule but how difficult is it to change?


Answer:

	1. According to the User Guide for the MX418, the stand adapter is model #A57F.
	
	2. The cartridges are very easy to change. You will notice that the very tip of the microphone unscrews.
