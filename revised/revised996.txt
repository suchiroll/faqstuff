Question:
I had a question about the wiring in the SM58. I have one and the bottom 3-pronged part came out and broke away from the wires. I need to know which wire (the blue or the red) goes to which prong. Thank you.


Answer:

	The blue wire goes to pin 2. The red wire goes to pin 3. A wiring diagram can be found in the SM58 User Guide.
