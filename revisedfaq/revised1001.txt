Question:
I am in possession of a turntable with a SHURE hifi magnetic cartridge (SHURE V-15 TYP III L-M). The turntable is by now quite old and I need to replace the needle (SHURE VN35 E-M 0.2x0.7 mil elliptical diamond needle for all microgroove and stereo records colour coding: black).


I would like to know if I can still purchase such a needle or if I have to replace the whole system. Could you kindly send me all relevant information?


Answer:

	The VN35MR replacement stylus will fit the V15 III cartridge and will restore the cartridge to its original performance.
	
	Order it through the Shure agent for your country () or Shure Parts at 800-516-2525 or 847-866-2699.
