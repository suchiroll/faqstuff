Question:
After trying many mics, I just purchased your KSM44.
1) Is there any difference in using the mic "upside down" vs. "rightside up"?


2) I will experiment, but as a starting point for recording strummed acoustic guitar in a pop mix, should I use the cardioid pattern with the mild low cut filter?



Answer:

	1. No difference.
	
	2. Yes.
