Question:
I have a Realistic R9000E LWS cartridge. It has Shure stamped on the cartridge where it is inserted into the arm of the turntable and the letters RE stamped in red ink on the end of the cartridge were the stylus is inserted. I have tried to purchase a replacement stylus from Radio Shack but they said they could not find it in their catalogue. Could you please help me?


Answer:

	The N95ED stylus will fit. Contact Shure Parts at 800-516-2525 to purchase the N95ED.
