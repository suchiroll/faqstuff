Question:
I am wanting to record vocals. I am going to be using an Audio Buddy preamp to connect the mic to my sound card on my computer. Is there any other things that I need to make this connection??


Answer:

	As all Shure professional microphones use an XLR connector and the Audio Buddy has XLR inputs, there will be no problem using the two together.
