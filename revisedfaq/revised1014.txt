Title: V15 V bad sound after stored for many years

Question:
I have an old Shure V15 Type V cartridge, which, although babied, hasn't been used for many years. I am trying to resurrect my record-playing system in order to copy my pristine 1970-80s collection to a computer disk, for later editing, compiling, and burning to CD-ROM.


When playing records, I get distortion as if the stylus is dusty (it's not). The rest of the playback system checks out, and I've realigned the cartridge. I assume that cartridges have a life span (?); is there any way to know if the whole cartridge needs replacement, or just the stylus? And what is the approximate price for replacements; I'm trying to keep this project somewhat reasonable in cost.


Answer:

	The cartridge body is likely fine. The problem is very likely in the stylus, particularly the rubber bushing that supports the stylus. A new stylus will restore the entire cartridge to original performance. The replacement stylus is the VN5MR.
