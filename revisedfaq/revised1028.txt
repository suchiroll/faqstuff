Question:
I need a power supply. The one that we have is broken. The model PS31. Can you direct me as to where I can get one?


Answer:

	A replacement can be ordered from Shure Parts at 800-516-2525.

	

	This power supply will also work:

	Triad AC/DC adapter - model WDU15-600

	AC input is 120 VAC / 15 watts.

	VDC output is 15 volts / 600 mA.

	DC outputcable is 72 inches in length.

	DC connector is 2.1 mm x 5.5 mm. DC connector does not have a locking collar like the Shure PS31.

	This is a linear supply, not a switching power supply.
