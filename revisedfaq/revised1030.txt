Id: 1030
Legacy Id: 1060

Question:
We own 9 PSM700's w/ 3 antenna combiner/dist. amps in out church. I was told that due to the strength of the transmitter output (100mW) that it is not recommended that we use the distribution amp/ antanna combiners. Is this true?


We have a distance of about 100 ft from stage to transmitter.


Answer:

	ThePA421SWB and PA821SWBantenna combiners can hande up to 100mW of RF power per input. There should be no problem with your configuration.
	
	You also mention distribution amplifiers. Please clarify with model numbers and where in the signal chain these amps are located.
