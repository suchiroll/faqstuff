Question:
One of our wireless systems is an older model (number T4 Diversity Receiver). The telescoping antenna broke off and I would like to know where I can get a replacement or can I get a flexable antenna to put on this unit like the other newer models that I have (UT4 receiver). I really like the flex antenna idea.


Answer:

	The telescoping antenna for the T4 receiver can be purchased from the Shure Service Parts department.
	
	The smaller antenna that comes on the UT4 receiver cannot be used because its not made to pick up the same frequencies as the antenna used on the T4 receiver.
