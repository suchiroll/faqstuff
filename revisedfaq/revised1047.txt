Question:
Our church choir purchased a BG 4.1 in the last year or so for use and recently the end connector came out. I cannot get the bottom sleeve off to try and re-connect it . How do I get the sleeve off without further damage to the mic? Do I have to send it in? If it must be sent in, what might the cost of repair be?
