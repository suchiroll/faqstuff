Question:
I was interested in some of your replacement mics for the wireless systems. I currently have a few L series systems and a few LX series systems. I needed something small like the WL50 for use in theatrical productions that would be inconspicuous and still pick up perfectly (I know that is impossible, but the closest to perfection is needed.). We also need a few headsets. I need something that's going to work well for singing Pop and Rock. To give you an idea, our next show is Tommy. That is the kind of musical singing that is going to be done.


Answer:

	The WL50 and Beta 53 would be perfect for you application. The Beta 53 was designed precisely for the theater performance application that you are doing. The next best headset would be the WCM16.
