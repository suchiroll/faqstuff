Question:
Will an N78S replacement needle will fit almost all Shure cartridges? Secondly, do I need a different RIAA correction when playing 78Â´s?


Answer:

	The N78S replacement stylus will only work with these current and discontinued Shure cartridges:
	
	Current Audiophile/hi-fi cartridges:
	V15VxMR
	M97xE
	M92E
	M78S
	
	Discontinued Audiophile/hi-fi cartridges:
	M111E
	M70BX
	M91 Series
	M92 Series (Pre 1975)
	M93
	M94E/MP94E
	
	Current DJ cartridges:
	M35S
	M35X
	SC35C
	
	Discontinued DJ cartridges:
	M44-7X
	M44GX
	
	78 rpm records had several settings, but RIAA is close enough to satisfy most requirements. If someone wants the exact equalization, they would need to research the producer of the 78 rpm disc and find equipment that has the proper playback equalization.
