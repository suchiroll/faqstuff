Question:
I am looking for a 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch adapter as shown in your current product A95UF.

This used to be manufactured by switchcraft. If you do not sell it separately, do you know a source where I could purchase about 100 of these?


Answer:

	The 1/2 inch connector on that adapter was made by Amphenol and called a model MC1F.
	
	The complete adapter was offered by Switchcraft as part 332A.
