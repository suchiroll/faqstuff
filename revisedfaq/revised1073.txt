Question:
I used to use the M44-7 for scratching. But since I am no longer into scratching I using the same for just listening pleasure at home with a new styli and its good.

You have mentioned that DJ cartridges are not recommended for home use. Is there any particular reason?

Do I have to replace my cartridge with a non DJ cartridges? Please advise.


Answer:

	Typically, the phonograph cartridges that you want to use for regular home listening should have a tracking weight of less than 2 grams and be flexible (compliant) to reduce wear on the vinyl.
	
	DJ cartridges tend to be less compliant and use a heavier tracking force so that the stylus wont skip and break in use.
	
	To prevent excessive wear on a long term basis, a hi-fi cartridge is best.
