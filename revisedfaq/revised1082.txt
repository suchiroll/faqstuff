Question:
Hi, I'm a French student in Paris, studying science and preparing engineer schools exams. I'd like to know if e-mailing me (technical) information about Shure wireless systems was possible. I need this kind of documents in order to prepare a talk about wireless systems; I will have to present this talk first to my teachers, and then to a jury during the competitive exams I will sit for.


P.S: I must also say that I've been playing the bass in a rock band for five years, that's why wireless systems interest me...
