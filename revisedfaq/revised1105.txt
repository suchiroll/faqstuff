	In descending levels of sound quality, we have the following phono cartridges available:
	
	Cartridge - Application - Mounting type
	V15VxMR - audiophile - standard

	M94E - music lover - standard
	MP94E - music lover - p-mount
	M92E - versatility - both
	M70BX - value - standard
	M78S - 78 RPM - standard
	
	Monophonic cartridge for playing wide-groove / 78 RPM records: M78S
	
	The N78S replacement stylus will work in any of the above cartridges, providing them with wide-groove / 78 RPM record playback capability.
	
	Shure also offers phono cartridges for professional DJ use. All DJ cartridges are standard mount, but these are not recommended for home audio use.
