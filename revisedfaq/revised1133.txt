Question:
Tech support has been most helpful in supplying a copy of the tech manual for the SE30 gated compression mixer. I am inquiring about the availability of the A100B rack mount "ears" for the SE-30. Are they still available, and, if so, how do I order them??


Answer:

	Very unlikely as the SE30 was discontinued nearly 30 years ago. Try Shure Parts at 800-516-2525.
	
	Also consider using a universal rack tray. Try: http://www.middleatlantic.com
