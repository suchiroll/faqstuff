Question:
I have a Roland 880EX 8 track. Its master output is connected to my home system. I can hook my guitar straight to a track and record (and hear what I'm playing through my home system) or go from my guitar to the guitar amp and from the amp output to a track. So my question is, besides wanting to use two mics to add layers or whatever, is there a reason behind going from guitar to amp to mic to track, rather then guitar to track? I read the microphones and multitracks handbook but did not see an explanation


Answer:

	Yes, there is a reason. The guitar will sound one way when played through an amp and miked, and sound different when played directly to the track. Consider each one a different timbre (tone color) and use whichever fits your sound better.
