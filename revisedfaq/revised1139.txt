Question:
I have an old Shure power amp and wanted to find out just how old it is. It is called a Shure Power Master, model PM 300. Please tell me how old it is if you can. It works well and looks like an oldie. Also wondering if your company buys things of this sort. Thank you and keep up the good work.


Answer:

	Information on the PM300 can be found in its user guide.
