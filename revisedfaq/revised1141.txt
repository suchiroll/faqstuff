Title: N78S Styli for V15 Type IV
Id: 1141
Legacy Id: 1179

Question:
I use a Shure V15 Type IV phono cartridge on my Harman/Kardon Rabco ST-7 straight line tracking turn table. Both the turn table and the cartridge are still performing extremely well, even after all these years. I have come across a bunch of old 78 RPM records that I would like to transfer onto CDs. In the booklet that came with the cartridge, it says that the VN-478E styli is what I should use for my needs. Checking your catalogue, this styli is not listed, therefore, I presume no longer available. However, there is mention that the N78S styli is for playing 78 RPM records and it should fit all currant cartridges. My question is, would a N78S styli fit into my V15 Type IV cartridge, and would it work to satisfaction.
