Question:
I am looking for a microphone product known as an apron microphone.

	We assume you are asking for a microphone to be placed at the front or apron of a stage. This is likely a boundary mic like the Shure MX390 series. Please see the following link to our online Selection Guides: Which microphone should I use on ... ? (Selection Guides)
