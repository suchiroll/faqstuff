Question:
I am looking into microphones for use in a short film. It needs to be very versatile for out door and indoor use. Unfortunately I lack the product knowledge necessary for choosing the proper tool. I have been told to look into shotgun mikes and boom mikes. Does your company carry these types of mikes? If not; can you refer me to one that does? What other types of products would you suggest. I am also looking for the equipment needed to record the sound and process it for transfer into a computer for editing. Any advice you can give me would be appreciated.
