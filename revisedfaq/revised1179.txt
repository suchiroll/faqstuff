Question:
Would like help knowing which mics for an a capella vocal group(5 members - 3 male , 2 female) you best recommend.


1) Is there that much difference in sound and quality between the Beta 58 and Beta 87 and is it noticeably a superior mic given the price difference? They will be used for live performance and recording. Thanks for your help as I look to purchase.


2) Does the Beta 87A have as good of pop and wind resistance as the Beta 58?

3) Are they as rugged in travel?



Answer:

	1)The Beta 58 is a dynamic element; the Beta 87 a condenser. Both mics sound great, but they sound different. It will be a personal preference, not a technical choice. Audition both at a Shure dealer is our best advice.
	
	2) Yes.
	
	3) The Beta 58 has far fewer parts than the Beta 87, and therefore has a very slight edge in ruggedness.
