Question:
Good morning, Although frequencies are listed on the equipment along with the letter codes, I am unable to match some of the wireless mics I now have with some new products because I can't find the frequencies listed in numeric form. Is there somewhere on your web page that will cross reference your VHF frequencies with your letter codes? If not, do you have a listing I could get. The letter system is actually quite confusing to me.
