Question:
I’m an adult that helps out with our High School Activities that has to do with sound. And I was wondering about what would be the best for me so I’ll tell you what I would like to have then if you could tell me what would be the best. Okay we have a 2 black boxes the top one has our mixer in it and the bottom one has the amplifer for our 4 speakers. We have 2 speakers in the auditorum area and 2 speakers on the stage. Now I was wondering we would like to get a set of 2 new wireless microphones, 2 body back transmitters for our guitar and keyboard. Also we would like to get 2 new clip-on microphones, and last 6 Choir mics. And for the Choir mics we would like to have ones that are meant for high school choirs that go on stands and don’t hang from the ceiling. I was wondering if you could tell me the best package that you have to meet my needs. Thank You ever so much.


Answer:

	Here are steps to take:

	
	1. Educate yourself about sound systems by reading: Audio Systems Guide for Houses of Worship at Educational Articles - Online booklets and bulletins
	
	2. Work with a local Shure sound installer to design a package that best meets your needs.
	
	Sound design by email is not feasible. Your auditorium must be seen, heard, and measured by aa audio professional to make certain the products to be purchased will operate properly.
