Question:
I have a vintage CR81 microphone. Please provide details.


Answer:

	This microphone was an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) model, i.e., Shure made the microphone for another equipment manufacturer.
	
	The CR81 was a Controlled Reluctance (Magnetic), high-impedance (14k ohm) model, light brown in color, made for Revere (Camera), a tape recorder manufacturer. The CR81 probably is from 1950s or 1960s when reel-to-reel tape recorders were popular.
	
	The outer case design, named Rex or Hercules, was reused for many microphone models with many different case colors.  Some had controlled reluctance elements, some dynamic elements, some crystal elements. Example models are:


	Model 510 - standard Shure model
