Question:
How do I connect 6 to 7 VHF (LX or SC) wireless receivers up to an antenna distribution system?


Answer:

	Antenna Distribution  6 or 7 Diversity VHF Receivers

	
		In applications involving multiple rack-mounted wireless microphone receivers, an antenna distribution system offers several advantages over mounting antennas on each individual receiver:
		
			
				Only 1 pair of antennas is required, making it more practical to remote-mount the antennas near the performance area.
			
				DC power can be distributed to each receiver, eliminating the need for multiple AC/DC power supplies.
			
				RF performance is improved by eliminating closely-spaced antennas on adjacent receivers, which interfere with each other.
		
	
	
		One pair of antennas is connected to the inputs of a WA405 Antenna Distribution System. One pair of outputs from this WA405 is connected to the inputs of a second WA405, while the remaining outputs feed the RF inputs of three diversity receivers. Another three or four diversity receivers are connected to the outputs of the second WA405. DC output jacks on each WA405 feed operating voltage to the receivers.
	
		The standard 1/4-wave whip antennas supplied with most Shure VHF wireless systems may be used if they are connected directly to the inputs on the front or rear of the WA405. If the antennas are to be mounted remotely, the accessory WA380 1/2-wave antennas must be used.
