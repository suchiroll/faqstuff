Question:
I have a set of ear molds manufactured by Westone laboratories. They are style #49 and were manufactured to insert ER15 attenuators. (They have a round hole in the end!) Can these be retrofitted to hold a pair of E5's and who could I contact to have this done?

Answer:

	It is highly doubtful. The E5s use a unique mold. Since the ear molds are made by Westone, contact them to see if they can help you. Please see the following link to our online FAQ:
