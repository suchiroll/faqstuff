Question:
I'm interested in buying 2 VPL/93 Wireless units. My question is it possible to use the two universal traveling frequencies 169.445 V and the 171.80 W at the same time or are the frequencies too close to one another. I want to have the two universals so as to give myself the greatest amount of trouble free use throughout the country.



Answer:

	Yes, frequency V and frequency W may be used at the same time.
