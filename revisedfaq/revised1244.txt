Question:
What is the wiring of the mini 3-pin xlr of the Beta 98 microphone. Which pin provides the 5V Bias Voltage and which pin is ground?


I want to use it with my AKG WMS 81 wireless System. My information is that AKG uses 6V Bias Voltage on pin 3




Answer:

	Pin 3 is Audio. Pin 2 is for bias voltage. Pin 1 is Ground.
	
	+6V dc of bias will work fine.
