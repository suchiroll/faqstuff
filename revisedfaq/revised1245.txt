Question:
One of my former employees inserted a 9V battery in reverse. I noticed that the transmitter became warm (about ten minutes later) and when I corrected the polarity, the transmitter no longer worked.


Question: Is it more cost effective to repair or replace the transmitter?


If Repair, what is my next step?


Model - UC1-UA
