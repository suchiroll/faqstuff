Question:
While going through my grandmothers belongings, after her death last year, I found a model "51" microphone, manufactured by "Shure brothers" is this the original name for the current "Shure" company? and if so is this something that I might want to hang on to? From what I understand this mic was used for several church functions and then stored in her brothers attic from the early 50's on. I would be greatful for any information you could give me.
