Question:
I need to get a new cable for my WM98. The cable on mine has a short in it. Please let me know if the cable is available seperatly.


Sorry. I actually need a new cable for a WM98, not an SM98. However, I noticed that your discription on your site says that it a four pin cable, but it is a three pin cable.


Answer:

	The cable for the WM98 is 3 pin the microphone end and 4 pin on the transmitter end. The replacement cable is part #90A4039 and can be ordered from our Parts Department at 800-516-2525.
