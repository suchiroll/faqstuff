Question:
I have a last minute request for a way to connect a small MP3 player to a wireless beltpack. How would you recomend I do this? I already have a Switchcraft TA4F connector and a stereo 1/8" mini for the MP3 player. My plan was to tie the + left and right output of the mini plug to pin 3 of the TA4F, and the the mini shield/sleeve to pin 1. Pin 2 and 4 would not be connected on the TA4F. I know I'll have to keep the gain way back on the beltpack to accomodate for the high output. Does this sound correct?



Answer:

	Yes, you are correct.
	
	Is there also an output level control on the MP3 player?
	
	If not, is there a headphone output with adjustable level? That can also be used.
