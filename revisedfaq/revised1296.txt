Question:
I'd really like to clean my SM58 Microphone but it seems the grill does not come off. Either that or I don't know how to remove it properly. I don't want to break the grill by mistake so can you give me some cleaning tips? If there's a way to take the grill off to clean it, I'd really love to know!! Thanks in advance.


Answer:

	The grill simply unscrews. If your grill is frozen, you may need to use a strap wrench to get enough leverage.
	
	Our Service Deparment can also do this for you. You can reach them at 800-516-2525 or 847-866-2699.
