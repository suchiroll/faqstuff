Question:
Are phantom power and bias voltage the same thing?

Answer:

	No. Phantom power is typically 11-52 Vdc that is supplied on the audio conductors of a balanced mic line. Bias voltage is usually lower (1.5-9 Vdc) and requires its own conductor. The two are not interchangeable. - more information -
