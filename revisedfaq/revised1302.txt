Question:
This may be a stupid question, but do you make the headset microphones used by artists such as Britney Spears, *NSYNC, and Backstreet Boys? If you look at any recent picture of them with a headset mic on, you'll see which one I am talking about. If you do not make them, do you happen to know what company does? Could you tell me? Thank you.


Answer:

	Artists change microphones frequently, so the term recent picture is relative. Shure offers a variety of headworn mics. See our Application Guide.
