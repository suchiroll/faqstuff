Question:
I have an ancient (but still functioning beautifully) Technics SL-7, and have been using for years a SHURE N111HE, can I get a new one here, or something compatible?

Answer:

	The N111HE stylus is no longer available. To see if we have any compatible replacement stylus for your cartridge, look at our online cartridge/stylus cross reference.
	
	Also see our current online cartridge catalog.
