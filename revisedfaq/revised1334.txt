Question:
I'd like to know about the schematic diagram for the SM81 microphone. Please answer as soon as possible in this matter.
Thanks.

Answer:

	As there are no user serviceable parts inside of the SM81, the schematic is not available to the public. If you require service for an SM81, please contact Shure service: http://www.shure.com/americas/support/service-repair
