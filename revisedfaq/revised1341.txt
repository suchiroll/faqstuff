Id: 1341

Question:
I have a Shure cartridge model or serial number (I don't know) SC39EJ in my Technics 1200. I need to replace the needle but I don't now what is the correct one, because I have a N55E, but I assume that it's a discontinued model, because it doesn't exist in the options of your page. Please guide me in my decision, because i don't know what new model is the correct for my old cartridge. I'm from Chile and here it's a little bit difficult to find Shure Needles in an accessible price.

Well, the answer was Ok, but I want to know how can I buy it, because in your page I read that you sale directly replacement parts and accesories, and I would know the order procedure, the payment system, etc.


Answer:

	The model number of your cartridge is the SC39EJ. The correct stylus replacement is the SS39EJ. As of July 2001, the U.S. retail price of the SS39EJ is $38.00.
