Thanks a lot! However, apart from using the lavalier mic (SM93 or WL93)with the T1, I also want to use it as an external mic with the Sony Video Camcorder VX1000. Sony gives following Mic in specifications: 0.388 mV low impedance with 2.5-3 V DC output, impedance 6.8 Kohms. Will SM93 or WL93 do the job?

Thank you.


Answer:

	Yes. Just disconnect the microphone from the SM93 preamp and plug it into the T1. If you have not yet bought an SM93, then you should instead buy a WL93. This is the same microphone, without the preamp (which you wont be using anyway).

	Lets assume the Sony is wired as follows: tip = audio; ring = bias; sleeve = ground. If the Sony is wired like this, make the following connections: tip = pin 3 (of WL93); ring = pin 2; sleeve = pin 1. Pin 4 is not used.
	
	But check with Sony first to confirm how the mic input jack is wired.
