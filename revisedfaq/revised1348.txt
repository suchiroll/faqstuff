Question:
Which microphone would be best for the following application:


Approximately 4 ft. round table; min. of two persons, with as many as 5 persons at table; relatively quiet surroundings; base of mic perhaps hidden in a flower arrangement; hard wired ok..have existing 3 pin hookups


Could this be done with one mic, or would two be better?


Answer:

	Assuming this microphone will be used for recording, we suggest one omnidirectional boundary microphone, like the Shure MX390 series.
