Question:
I have a 1967 vintage Marantz SLT-12 turntable. I am fairly confident that this turntable has a Shure phono cartridge attached (a V15 I believe) to it. I did pick up a replacement needle (from the "Needle Doctor" in Minneapolis) so it is working.


However, I have the original needle that is labeled "SLT". It would be nice to be able to put the original needle with the "SLT" label showing on this very unique turntable. Would it be possible to retip this? If so, does Shure do this? If not, who does?


Thanks!



Answer:

	Would it be possible to retip this? * No.
	
	If so, does Shure do this? * No.
	
	If not, who does? * To our knowledge, no company retips styli. It is impossible to remove the old diamond without damaging the stylus shank.
