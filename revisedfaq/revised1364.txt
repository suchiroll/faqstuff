I purchased a Shure LX4 wireless system with the headset. I now would prefer a handheld. Which mic should I get to match the receiver? Some info off my unit:


LX4-CP 196.600 MHz


Thank you in advance for your assistance. I wish to purchase the handheld unit ASAP.


Answer:

	Purchase the LX2/58-CP. As of July 2001, the U.S. retail is $451.36. Note: You can only use one transmitter at a time since both will be on the same frequency.
