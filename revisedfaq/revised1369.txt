Title: U Series low frequency response
Id: 1369
Legacy Id: 1421

Question:
Can you provide audio frequency response for all three components (handheld transmitter, beltpack and diversity receiver) of the U124M/58 system?


Specifically, I need to know the -3dB low-frequency cutoff of audio carried on the RF link between the transmitters and the receiver.



Answer:

	The low frequency 3dB down point of the RF link is 40 Hz; this is independent of the transducer.
