Question:
Can you recommend a replacement for the R1000E cartridge.  Your web site recommends the N91ED but I can only find N91ED-T2 Styli at the various shops I have visited around my home.

Is the N91ED-T2 unit compatible with the R1000E cartridge and is this the same unit referenced by Radio Shack part number 970-1174?

Answer:

	The N91ED replacement stylus is still available directly from Shure Service and Parts.
	
	Installing the N91ED into the R1000E will provide like new performance.
	
	The Radio Shack part 970-1174 may or may not be an original Shure stylus. It could be a third party replacement stylus.
