Question:
I just want to let you know how happy I am with your service/technical support people. I have a couple of old Shure products, an M68FC mixer and a SR105B power amplifier I just acquired. I've called your support people a couple of times with questions the manuals didn't answer, at least to my understanding. The support people were very friendly and knowledgeable and actually answered my questions with real answers or solutions. It's really nice to know there is a company out there that actually supports equipment they made, albeit a long time ago, so it's an easy decision to continue buying Shure products knowing the support is out there and seemingly will be in the future. Thanks for great products. Thanks for great support.


Answer:

	Thank you for the compliment regarding the applications support you received from Shure.
	
	Shure is dedicated to prompt, accurate, and honest applications support. It is wonderful to hear from a customer that is satisfied with our efforts.
