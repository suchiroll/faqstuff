Question:
I have a percussion set up of 17 drums, 3 congas, 10 cymbals, 2 hi-hats, 2 chimes, 1 gong, and a cow bell. I have the financial resources to separately mike the drums and congas, but I do not know what mikes will give me the best overall performance. Also, how should I mike the cymbals, chimes, and other misc percussion?
