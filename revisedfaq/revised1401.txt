Question:
I have a Shure SM5B that need repairs. Are there any Shure dealers in the L.A. area or do I have to send it in to you?


Answer:

	Sorry, Shure has not serviced the SM5B model for many years.
	If you require electronic/acoustic repair, contact vintage mic collector Jim Webb.
	Jim may have contacts to individuals that can repair the SM5B.
	Also try: Mooretronix
	
	If you decide to replace the SM5B, consider the SM7B.
