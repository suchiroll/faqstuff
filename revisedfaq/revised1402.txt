Question:
I have two old Shure cartridges, the V15 RS and the M97HE, which have not been used for the last 15 years or so, and both need new styuses (styli?). According to your stylus replacement chart, neither of these models any longer have replacement styluses available. I was wondering if there is an available stylus that could be substituted for the discontinued replacement stylus.


Answer:

	Call Shure Parts as they have an inventory of discontinued styli. Replacement stylus can be purchased from the Shure Parts Department at 847-866-2699 or 800-516-2525.
