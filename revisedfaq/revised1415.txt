Question:
Do you have any headworn microphones that come with a cough button? If not do you have any headworn microphones that can have a cough button attached?


Answer:

	Shure headworn mics are not supplied with a cough button. However, the A120S switch (or WA 360 if wireless) can be added to most headworn mics.
