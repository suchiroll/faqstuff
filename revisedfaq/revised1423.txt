Question:
I recently bought a Shure Prologue 16L Lo Z Condenser Microphone, used, and I was looking for the specs and user guides on your website but couldn't find anything. And is the output balanced?


Answer:

	See the User Guide for the 16A
	
	It is the same as the 16L. And the XLR 600 ohm output is balanced.
