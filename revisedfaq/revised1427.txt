Question:
Our band has been using this monitor for the past 2 years and love it and have had great service.  Recently, we've experienced  a few minor problems with the wire/headset such as shorts, earpiece got broke,etc.  Is it possible to purchased that piece by itself? We need 3. I would appreciate any help or assistance you could give me.
