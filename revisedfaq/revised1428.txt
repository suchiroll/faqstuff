Question:
In this moment I use the VR300 Lo-Z microphone in our product. In web site of SHURE I didn't find any information about it. It is active or no? Please, I have a question for you about the dynamic microphone. I'm looking for a dynamic microphone with high sensitivity, unidirectional who can be used from talker at 1m-2m distance. The frequency response will be in 300-4000 hz range. This mic I'd want to replace actually mic VR300 because the client said that it has not much sensitivity. If you can help me I apreciate you.


Answer:

	The VR300 has the same specifications as the 503BG.
	
	The VR300 and 503BG are designed to be used very close to the talkers mouth, within 5 cm.
	
	As an alternative, consider the model 545SD.
	
	The 545SD is more sensitive than the VR300 and may work better.
