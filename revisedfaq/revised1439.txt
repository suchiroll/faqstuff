Question:
I'm a drummer (beginner!!!), so I want to amplify my drumset, but I can't buy something really expensive. I want like 2 omnidirectional mics for overheads and one mic for the bass drum. So what mics do you recommend to me?


Answer:

	1) First, read: Microphone Techniques for Drums2) Then, consider the model PGA81 for overhead; model PGA52 for kick drum.
