Question:
I recently bought the new «The Headset» from you guys, and to my dismay, it's right-handed... Is there a way to convert the WH-20 that I have to left-hand or do I have to return this one for a left-handed model? I neglected to observe this when purchased, but need the headset promptly for gigs coming up.


Answer:

	Sorry. The WH20 is only available on the right hand side. It cannot be switched to the left hand side; and there is no left hand version of the WH20. The WCM16 is on the left hand side, but is more expensive.
