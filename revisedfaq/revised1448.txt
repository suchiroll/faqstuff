Question:
I can't seem to find a replacement for a R25 EDT cartridge.


Answer:

	The Shure N75EJT2 replacement stylus should fit the R25EDT body. Replacing the stylus returns your phono cartridge to like new condition.
	
	If you want a brand new cartridge, the Shure M92E phono cartridge is a good choice.
