Question:
If the cable is only going to be about 2 - 3 feet long between the LX receiver and the mixer, is there any SIGNIFICANT difference in signal loss between using the XLR output low impedance, balanced signal sent on a cable that uses XLR connectors versus using the 1/4" output unbalanced, high impedance signal using 1/4" connectors?


Answer:

	For a short run of several feet, there will not be a difference in signal loss. The unbalanced 1/4 cable will still be more susceptible to electrical interference.
