Title: Replacement Stylus for V15 III DU
Id: 1456
Legacy Id: 1509

Question:
I have a Shure Cartridge V15 III DU and now I need a new stylus.


Answer:

	Our records do not show a V15 III DU, but we do show a V15 III DL. It was supplied with certain DUAL turntables.
	
	If your unit is the V15 III DL, the replacement stylus was the VN35E and is no longer available from Shure.
