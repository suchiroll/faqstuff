Question:
I really like this headset. I was wondering how I could use it with an in-house intercom system that is designed to accept the 4 pin XLR connections?


Answer:

	Very likely it will work. Obtain the pinout of the intercom from the manufacturer and wire the SM12A appropriately.
	Consider sending the SM12A data sheet to the intercom manufacturer to determine its compatibility.
