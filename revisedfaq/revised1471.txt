Question:
I purchaced a Shure Mic Model 7308 at a yard sale. Could you provide me with a brief history and approx value.

PS: I am still using my "58" that I purchaced new in 1970. I ususally play at least 100 jobs a year with this mic. Thanks for a great product.

After viewing the faq pages I have discovered that the model # on this mic is indeed a 730B. But the mic looks like a model 55. This mic does not in any way resemble the photo of the 730B. Also model 55 in your faq is a moving coil design where as my model 730B claims to be a crystal design. Could you clarify this for me? Also do you have an approx. value for this unit.

	If your 730B does not look like this data sheet, we have no idea what product you have. Perhaps it has been mislabelled by a previous owner. Shure does not offer pricing advice on old microphones. Shure does not buy or sell vintage microphones. Try an antique mic web site like: http://www.k-bay106.com/photos.htm
	
	Or check ebay.
