Question:
Can you please advise me if the VPL/93 microphone with an integrated WH20 headset can be used in a USB input connector on a computer? If not, what connectors can you provide to make compatible with my laptop application?


Answer:

	A professional mic made will require a preamp interface, like the Shure X2u,to connect to a USB port.Using the X2u, you can choose virtually any professional mic that suits your needs.
