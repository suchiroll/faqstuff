Question:
I happen to have an old Shure 55SW with the oldbuckled cable still tied up with a label. It all comes in a red velvet original bag...


Not a scratch on anything. Its all in tip-top shape, seems like it have just been bought out of a store in the 50's.


How much can this be worth? Any idea?
