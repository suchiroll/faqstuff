Question:
I have an old wireless lapel system and want to know if I can adapt a headworn mic instead of the tieclip mic. I don't like the sound of the lapel mic and want to try a headworn to see if it helps any.


Answer:

	It depends on which wireless system you have, but with most Shure systems, you can just plug a headworn microphone into the bodypack transmitter.
