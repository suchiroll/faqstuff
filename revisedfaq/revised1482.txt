Question:
I own a Shure M75-6 TYPE 2. What is the modern equivalent and how much would it cost?



Answer:

	Option 1: Replace the stylus with a new stylus, model N75-6. This will restore your M75-6 Type 2 to like-new performance. Finding one may be difficult as Shure no longer makes it.
	
	Option 2: Replace the entire cartridge with Shure model M44-7.
