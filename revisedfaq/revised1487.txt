Question:
I am interested in upgrading my bands monitoring system. My band is currently a five piece, and I need a solution that will best serve my purpose. What I need to know is, how many systems will I have to buy to accomodate a five piece band all with PSM's? I have been told that I can run five sets with one transmitter. I hope this is correct.


Also, what advantages will I have by using a limiter to control sound peaks to conserve hearing loss.


Answer:

	What I need to know is, how many systems will I have to buy to accommodate a five piece band all with PSMs?

	* If everyone will be satisfied listening to the same stereo mix, you require one transmitter and five receivers. Or you can have two independent mono mixes using the same set up.
	
	What advantages will I have by using a limiter to control sound peaks to conserve hearing loss?

	* There are limiters in each PSM receiver to control sound peaks. We suggest these limiters always be used. Putting a high quality limiter just before the PSM transmitter input is often done by professional bands, just to have yet another level of hearing protection.
