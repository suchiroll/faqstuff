Question:
How many mics/transmitters will run on one receiver. I am presuming five, but perhaps I misread the information. Also, if multiples are available, are they different frequencies?


Answer:

	How many mics/transmitters will run on one receiver? * One transmitter.
	
	If multiples are available, are they different frequencies? * Each transmitter requires its own receiver; and each transmitter/receiver pair requires its own unique frequency.
