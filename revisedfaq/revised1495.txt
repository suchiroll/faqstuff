Answer:

	Assuming you are going to use the microphone on a microphone stand as opposed to a microphone on the violin itself, we recommend thePG81 microphone along with the A96F adapter.
	
	ThePG81 is a condenser microphone made for recording purposes such as yours. You can use a AA battery to power this microphone. Then use the A96F transformer adapter to change the XLR output of the microphone to a mini-stereo plug. It will also block the dc voltage from the mini-disc recorder to prevent any damage to the microphone.
