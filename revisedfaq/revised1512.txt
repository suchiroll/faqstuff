Title: V15V Replacement Stylus - VN5MR

Question:
I have a mid 80's vintage V15V cartridge which I tried to use recently and it apparently has suffered "stylus bushing" failure, as it will not track anything and the cantilever won't even budge.  I know the ADC turntable is fine, because it works flawlessly with the ADC XLM cartridge that originally came with it before I "upgraded" to the V15V.  Your recommended replacement stylus VN5MR is pretty pricey for the rare times I expect to play records.  Will any of your cheaper replacement stylus work in my V15V with satisfactory results?  Will a new Shure replacement stylus have the rubber bushing deteriorate and seize up over time like my V15V stylus did?

Answer:

	Will any of your cheaper replacement stylus work in my V15V with satisfactory results?

	* Sorry, but no. Only the VN5MR will work properly with your cartridge.

	
	Will a new Shure replacement stylus have the flexible bushing deteriorate and seize up over time like my V15V stylus did?

	* All cartridges use rubber bushings which are eventually attacked by the ozone in the atmosphere. It is the same as tire rot.

	

	Sorry, Shure no longer has inventory of the VN5MR stylus.
