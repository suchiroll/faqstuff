Question:
Hi. I have had this microphone for quite some time, and I am trying to find out a little bit of information about it. The microphone is in perfect condition and still works great. Many offers have been made by people to purchase it from me, but I am clueless as to what the value would be. Also, I printed the data sheet on this microphone that you provide at your website, but the microphone pictured looks a little different than mine, although the model numbers are the same. The microphone its self looks the same, but the base where the cord plugs in dosen't have the bigger label as shown. Any information that you could give me on this microphone would be very helpful and much appreciated.


Answer:

	The 737A dates from 1949. The price was $39.75. It was available with four different base styles.
