Question:
We require a microphone to be used on a oil-rig that has to be sealed so that it is not possible to generate a spark. Do you do such a mic and to what standard is it constructed?


Answer:

	If a mic is completed sealed, no air could hit the diaphragm and the mic would not operate.
	
	Can a microphone generate a spark?
