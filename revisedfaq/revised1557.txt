Question:
This miniature XLR connector seems to be almost non-existant outside of Shure's application. I haven't been able to get any of my local electronics suppliers to even find it, much less get it. Are they available thru Shure? My 'local' rep is in Montana, according to the Website, but its just as easy to purchase online direct from Shure as it is to get to a rep that might as well be in another country. Who manufactures this thing? What is the part number on it?
