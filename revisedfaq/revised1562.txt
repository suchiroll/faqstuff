Question:
Some friends and I have just started a semi-band together. I have been using a Shure microphone. I sound very good singing along with the acoustic (without a mike), but put me in front of a mike and I sound bad. What can I do to sound better?


My buddy suggested that maybe some reverb and sustain would help. He says many singers use these to sound better. Any tips on how to sing into the mike and what types of effects may or may not help would be appreciated.

	Try recording yourself during rehearsal. This will help you hear your faults.

	Reverb is commonly used, but do not use it as a crutch.
