Question:
I own a Shure single diversity VHF "Headset" wireless system. The headworn mic is broken - the cable got stretched. Can I plug an aftermarket headset mic into the 1/4" jack on the beltpack transmitter? Is the factory mic dynamic or condenser? If the aftermarket mic won't work, can I buy a new one from the factory? The dealer that I purchased it through doesn't sell replacement parts, and I don't think it needs to be sent back to the factory for an external mic that just needs to be plugged into the beltpack transmitter.


Answer:

	Can I plug an aftermarket headset mic into the 1/4" jack on the beltpack transmitter?
	* It depends upon the specs of the mic.
	
	Is the factory mic dynamic or condenser?
	* Dynamic.
	
	If the aftermarket mic won't work, can I buy a new one from the factory?
	* Why not send it to Shure Service for repair? It will be cheaper than buying a new one. Call 800-516-2525.
