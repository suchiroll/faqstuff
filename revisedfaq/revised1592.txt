Question:
Should the WBH53 Microphone work ok with a wireless transmitter as I have just purchased the microphone to replace a broken WCM16. It sounds very weak, poor sound. Should it work please help.


Answer:

	Yes, the WBH53 should work. But it will sound very different than the WCM16. The WCM16 is a hypercardioid mic and will have more bass response.
	
	The WBH53 may be working properly, but you simply do not like the sound. Perhaps you should buy another WCM16.
