Question:
I have an old V15 Type IV cartridge that needs a new stylus. Radio Shack seems to have one for about $40.00. Another choice is for me is to buy a new M97XE. Would I be better off with a new M97XE or the old V15 Type IV with a new stylus.


Answer:

	The M97xE will provide superior performance. We suggest the new cartridge over the replacement V15IV stylus.
