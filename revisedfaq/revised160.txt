Question:
I'm looking for a tie-clip single-mount mic clip to use on an SM84 Lav mic.  I don't think these are made anymore, but I wonder if the new clips in your RK183T1 accessory pack would work with these mics?

Answer:

	The new tie clips will not fit the old SM84. Call our Parts Department at 800-516-2525 or 847-600-8699 to see if any SM84 tie clips are still available.
