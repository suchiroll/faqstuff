Question:
Can you build me a combination headset microphone/ headphone in UHF, frequency agile, battery level indicator, w/ a temple pad style headset (like Madonna uses, only I wouldn't need the range of a singer as a DJ)? What will it cost me?


Answer:

	Shure does not build custom wireless systems.
	
	We suggest you review our entire line of wireless headworn mics on our web site.
