Title: Audio Frequency Chart

Question:
I have been a long time user of SM58 and other Shure mics. My question is more general in nature. Do you know where I might find a listing or chart that shows different instruments, different drums, male voice and female voice and the normal frequency ranges for each? I am doing some recording and this type of chart would be really handy. Thanks for any help you can give me.


Answer:

	See Section 2 of the following book: Microphone Techniques for Music - Studio Recording
