Title: Replacement styli for SPS Series
Id: 1613
Legacy Id: 1670

Question:
I have looked at your stylus/cartridge cross reference page and I find no mention of the SPS (Shure Performance & Sound) series of cartridges.  These were made in the late 1970s.  I'm interested in the stylus specifications and availability of replacements for the cartridge models MG956 and Pro-9 which were in this series.  Can you advise?  Thanks.

Answer:

	The SPS line had many different model numbers depending on what hi-fi chain sold it. As of August 2001, Shure Service has a small stock of SPS styli. We suggest that you return your old stylus to Shure Service. They will compare it to the remaining styli and, if they find a match, they will contact you with the model number and price.
