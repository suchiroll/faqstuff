Question:
I recently purchased an M367 Shure mixer.


Now I need to be able to connect the M367 to my Sony TRV900 camera. I note that the mixer output has two male XLR outputs which I need to connect to a stereo mini plug to insert into the camera input. I imagine I will need to have such a cable made for me? Is there a technical way I should describe this cable when I request it?


Answer:

	Yes, there is a technical description.
	
	A. Use standard mic cable with two twisted inner conductors and a shield.
	
	B. XLR pin 2 to inner conductor #1 to tip and ring of 3.5mm mini plug
	
	C. XLR pin 3 to inner conductor #2 to sleeve of 3.5mm mini plug
	
	D. XLR pin 1 to shield. No connection at 3.5mm mini plug
