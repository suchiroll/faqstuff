Question:
I would like to know if is possible to install a Beta 87C Handheld microphone in a LX Wireless system. Actually I have a LX2/BETA58 but in a live performance I have a problem with ambient Noise using my PSM600 Ear monitor. In substance, I would to keep best quality but reduce the ambient noise. It's a possible way? Is there another solution for the problem?


Answer:

	Yes, the Beta 87C wireless cartridge (part number RPW100) will fit your LX2 transmitter. Unscrew the Beta 58 cartridge and screw on the RPW100.
	
	Many performers using the PSM are changing to cardioid cartridges. We believe it will help solve your problem.
