Title: Value of vintage Microphone 55S series
Id: 1618
Legacy Id: 1675

Question:
I have recently run across a 55S model Shure microphone. It is really cool looking and I was just wondering, are these things worth any money? This mike has all the tags still on it. Shines like new. It is certainly a thing to look at. Is attached to a Dazor Floating Fixture. Can you direct me to anyone who might be interested in acquiring such a piece? Thanks much for any help you can offer.


Answer:

	Shure does not buy old microphones and therefore we cannot tell you its value. See the following:
