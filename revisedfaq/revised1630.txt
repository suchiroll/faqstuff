Question:
I'm looking for a preamp for an old turntable, and I keep seeing references on eBay to the model M64 you used to make. Is there a current turntable preamp available?


Answer:

	The M64 is no longer available. An Internet search using phono preamp will provide multiple sources for this type of device.
