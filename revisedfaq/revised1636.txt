Question:
I have been advised that Phantom power will damage the Mic Outputs on a U4D/U4S  UC4.


Are the U4D/U4S (Both V1  V2, although I believe that V1  V2 only relates to how the U4D talks to a UA888) and UC4 RX protected from Phantom Power, or will Phantom Power damage some of the circuitry in the receiver?


Answer:

	All Shure wireless receivers are protected from damage by phantom power.
