Question:
I have an old Shure 556 Unidyne microphone serial# H7463. And I was wondering if and where I could get a converter so I could use it in regular mic. jacks. It has one of those big three prong plugs, but it is far to big to plug into a modern adapter.


Answer:

	The 556 used a 3 pin Amphenol connector, part #MC3M. We do not carry these connectors.You can get pre-wired cables from Tom Ellis (214-328-3225.
