Question:
Are the older Shure microphones model 545S-Unidyne 3 undirectional dynamic microphone and the 545S impedance microphone the same microphone with a different description or are they two different mics?


Answer:

	545S is the model number. Unidyne III is the design of the mic element. The 545 models have always used the Unidyne III element. Therefore, a 545S Unidyne III is the same as the 545S.
