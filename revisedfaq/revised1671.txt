Question:
I have a Shure Bros 707A Mic, maybe late 40's 0r 50's. It needs an element, can I still get these from Shure? If not do you have another source for new, usedor rebuild?


Answer:

	Unfortunately all such parts are long gone at Shure. You might have luck with collectors of old mics. We suggest you start with: Tom Ellis
