Question:
I am wondering if there is a definitive answer to the question "which cartridge causes least wear to the record?"


I would think that the micro-edge knife-shaped stylus would cause more wear, even though it tracks better than the elliptical, because the pressure per square area would be greater. So if my primary concern is preserving records rather than absolute best fidelity I would be better with a high quality elliptical stylus rather than the top-of-the-line micro-edge model.


Another question: Most of my records are used records from yard sales, etc. some of which unfortunately already have audible mistracking damage. Could I expect with the micro-edge stylus I would not hear this damage since the stylus would ride lower in the groove, which would be undamaged by the larger cheap styluses that caused the damage?


Answer:

	If there is a definitive answer to the question which cartridge causes least wear to the record? * To our knowledge, no conclusive scientific research exists.
	
	I would think that the micro-edge knife-shaped stylus would cause more wear, even though it tracks better than the elliptical, because the pressure per square area would be greater. * In theory, yes. But micro-ridge tips tend to be very, very highly polished, and offsets to some extent the greater pressure per square inch.
	
	Could I expect with the micro-edge stylus I would not hear this damage since the stylus would ride lower in the groove, which would be undamaged by the larger cheap styluses that caused the damage? * You will likely hear less damage as the stylus rides lower in the groove. But we cannot guarantee that you will. It depends upon the groove damage.
