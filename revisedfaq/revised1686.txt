Question:
I want to mike my resonator directly into a guitar amp. What do I need to convert the male end of the XLR to a standard input jack?


Answer:

	Obtain the Shure A95UF transformer. Connect it to the end of your mic cable and plug the A95UF into your guitar amp.
	
	The A95UF converts the low impedance, balanced signal from the mic into a high impedance, unbalanced signal similar to a guitar signal.
