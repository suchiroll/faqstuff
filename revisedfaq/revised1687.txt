Title: Phantom mics and FP22

Question:
will phantom power shoved up the mic input hurt my FP22? ie for when I want to troubleshoot a condensor mic etc.
Is the transformer capacitively coupled to the xlr sockets?

I was thinking also perhaps building a phantom power circuit into mine… (yes
I know the warranty would be void…)
What I am really asking for is where I can see a FP22 circuit diagram?

yes, I do mean the FP22. It is the xlr socket I am talking about that
operates at mic (or line) level. Where I come from I’d call that a mic
input. Among other things, I use it for listening to microphones. All I want
from you is the information requested please

Thankyou for this.
By the way, I just found that I had got the circuit diagram all along! in
the user guide included with the unit… duh


Answer:

	Are you certain you mean the FP22. The FP22 is a stereo headphone amplifier. It has no microphone input. It has an XLR loop-through for mic or line level signals. But its no microphone preamp.

	"will phantom power shoved up the mic input hurt my FP22?" * Phantom power will not harm the FP22. Phantom power applied to the FP22 XLR male connector will also appear at the FP22 female XLR. The FP22 may be used "for listening to microphones".
	
	Is the transformer capacitively coupled to the xlr sockets? * No. The input transformer is connected directly to the FP22 XLR connectors.
	
	What I am really asking for is where I can see a FP22 circuit diagram? A service manual may be obtained from Shure Europe Service. There may be a charge. Contact Shure Europe at: support@shure.de
	
	I hope this answers all your questions.
