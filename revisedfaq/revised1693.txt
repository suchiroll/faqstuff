Title: Replacement for 50AC
Id: 1693
Legacy Id: 1750

Question:
At Fuji news in London UK we use a 50AC acoustic coupler which has proved useful for reporters in the field. I would like to get hold of another or similar device, any sources?


Answer:

	We wish we could help. The 50AC was discontinued nearly 10 years ago due to very poor sales. We have been unable to locate any other manufacturer of such a device, probably because of the extremely small potential market.
	
	You might try companies that make acoustic modems as the operational concept is similar.
