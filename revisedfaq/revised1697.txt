Question:
my church has a T series (T3 receiver) and sm58 wireless microphone setup. I want to get another wireless mic and was considering the TV58S. Would both microphones have their own frequency? Would their be any "conflict" with these two recievers / transmitters? thanks in advance for any help you could give me.
