Title: Parts for PE585
Id: 1699
Legacy Id: 1756

Question:
Recently, I acquired four of the renown Shure PE585 Unisphere A Dynamic microphones, for use on my newly acquired TEAC reel-to-reel 4-track tape recorder. All the mics need new wind/pop filters and one may need a new mic cartridge because it produces a noticeably weaker output signal than the others.


How/where can I obtain these parts?


Answer:

	The PE585 was discontinued in 1981. It is unlikely that Shure Service still has replacement parts.
	
	For replacement parts, please contact ourParts Department at 800-516-2525 or 847-600-8699.
