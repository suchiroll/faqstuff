Question:
I have some questions regarding the availability of a cartridge with a stylus for a record player. I have been told that SHURE has some products. I live in the US and I was wondering in which stores I would find such a product.


Can I go to an electronics store like Fry's Electronics/Good Guys and ask for it or do I have to go to some specific music stores?


Answer:

	Telephone the Shure rep for your area. The rep will have a list of Shure dealers in your area that carry phono products: http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/WhereToBuy/SalesReps/index.htm
