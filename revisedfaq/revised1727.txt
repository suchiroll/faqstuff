Question:
I am having difficulty finding a cartridge to play my old cd-4 quad records with.  Can you provide me with a list of the cartridges that Shure made that either came with a Shibata stylus or were able to be upgraded to a Shibata? I have no problem finding old cartridges, just need to know what I am looking for. 


Answer:

	In the 1970s, Shure manufactured the M24H cartridge. It was the only Shure model made for Quadraphonic playback.
	
	Shure no longer sells the M24H or the N24H replacement stylus. The stylus featured Hyperbolic long-contact tip geometry. This was likely very similar to a Shibata tip.
