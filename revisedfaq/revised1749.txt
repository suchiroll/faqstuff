Title: What type of Input connection does the SCM800 have on front panel?

Question:
We have a couple SCM800's in an auditorium. We want to connect some conferencing equipment to one of them temporarily. There is a 1/4" Input jack on the front panel but I can't tell from the specifications (user guide) if this is a balanced TRS type jack or unbalanced (I realize I might have missed something).


The conferencing equipment is a Gentner AP800 so we can generate a balanced output.

If we have a mono line level signal from the Output on the

Gentner should we use a mono 1/4 plug (which would ground the

unused right channel) or use a stereo 1/4plug and leave the

ring open (or connected to ???).


Thanks again for your quick answers!


Answer:

	The Aux input on the front panel (and rear panel) is unbalanced. It is wired:
	
	Tip and Ring: resistively isolated, then summed together
	Sleeve: ground
	
	It is designed to have a stereo 1/4" connector plugged into it with left on tip, right on ring, and ground on sleeve. The tip and ring are summed together inside the mixer to form a mono signal. This connector is line level.
