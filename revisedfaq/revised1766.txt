Question:
I own a SM58 Vocal Artist VHF set (T series), and it includes a very handy plastic 17" carrying case.
I'm planning to purchase the UHF Vocal Artist (UT series) with Beta58A mic, but does this set also feature that handy carrying case?


Answer:

	Yes, the UT system also includes a plastic carrying case.
