Question:
I bought myself a pair of M44-7 needles. I'm into scratching, so I placed the headshell weight(the one that is included with the M44-7) on top of the cartridge. I followed all the instructions, finally I wanted to balance my tonearm. But it wouldn't balance, no mather how far I flipped the balance wheel back. Is the needle supposed to be so heavy and isn't this bad for my vinyl???.
