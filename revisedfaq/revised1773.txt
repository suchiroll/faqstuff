Question:
I have found a reference in your knowledge base to the cartridge and stylus for this device - but it does not answer my query.


I have the original cartridge and stylus on this and I need to replace the stylus. Can I do this with one of your N92E or will I also need the 800E cartridge?


Answer:

	The 800E cartridge is discontinued. The N92E stylus is discontinued. The N104E stylus is a direct substitute and is available. 99% of the time, replacement of the stylus is all that is required to return the cartridge to like new condition.
