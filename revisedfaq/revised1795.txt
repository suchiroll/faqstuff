Question:
I am a blues harmonica player. I currently use the Shure Green Bullet and have been very pleased with the tone. I have been recently informed that my blues harp hero, Paul Butterfield, used your Shure 545SD Unidyne III (manufactured 1974-1993) and your Shure 565S Unisphere I (manufactured 1967-1978.) Do you currently produce any models that would be comparable in tone to these two?


Answer:

	Do you currently produce any models that would be comparable in tone to these two?
	
	Yes, you can still buy the 545SD-LC and the 565CD-LC. Either will still have the same classic tonal quality of the models used by Butterfield.
