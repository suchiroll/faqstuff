Title: Restoring a PE588B-CN microphone
Id: 1797
Legacy Id: 1857

Question:
I have an old PE588B-CN microphone passed on to me from my uncle bought in 1978. It seems that I am unable to purchase replacement parts for that model. I am in need of a new cable, grill and switch. Is there any newer models that perhaps may fit my model? And one more question, if I were to get it sent in, would the company rebuild the microphone? Money is no object. I need to get this done. It means a lot to me especially now my uncle is passed away.

Answer:

	Is there any newer models that perhaps may fit my model?
	* No. Parts for newer models will not fit your PE588.
	
	Would the company rebuild the microphone?
	* No. We do not have the parts. There are individuals that restore old microphones. Try Jerry Silva at: silclass@aol.com
	
	Here are other ideas:
	
	New Cable: A local music store will have a cable that will fit. Make certain to bring the microphone to the store.
	
	New Grill: Try reshaping the grill yourself. A wooden file handle can be used to press out dents.
	
	New Switch: It is likely to just be dirty. Try electronic contact cleaner from a local electronics parts shop.
