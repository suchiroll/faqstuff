Title: Vampire clip for lavalier

Question:
I was needing a part for a Shure UC1-UB wireless Lav mic. The mic it's self is a Micro-miniature Omnidirectional Lavalier. Our pastor clips the mic close to the knot of his tie. Someone said they make a  device that you thread(?) through the knot of your tie. I think its called a vampire clip. Do you have anything like what I've described?

	This clip will also work with the WL93 microphone
