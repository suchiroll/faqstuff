Question:
I have two of the KSM32 mics, the champagne with the shockmount  case, etc. Now I'm intrigued by the new KSM27. I know it has its own shockmount, but is this mic compatible with the KSM32 accessories?. That is:


1. Will the KSM27 mic fit in one of the KSM32 shockmounts?

2. Will the 27 mic fit on that Shurelock swivelmount that I also have?

3. Will the 32 mic fit in the 27 mount?


Answer:

	1. No. The KSM27 body is larger then the saddle used in the shock mount for the KSM32.
	2. Yes.
	3. The KSM32 will thread into the shockmount for the KSM27, but the saddle in the shockmount will be too large and the KSM32 will be loose in the shockmount.
