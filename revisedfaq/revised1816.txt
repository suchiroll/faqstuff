Question:
We currently have several wireless systems in the VHF range (170 - 200 MHZ). We want to get 3 or 4 additional wireless units for drama. Do the frequencies of UHF systems affect the VHF systems and visa versa.


Answer:

	As a general rule, the UHF and VHF systems are far enough apart in frequency so they will not have a problem with each other.
