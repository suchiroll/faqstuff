Question:
Our singer as been asked by every soundman "is that how loud you sing?" She lacks volume. Some have suggested a microphone that would better pick-up her quiet singing voice. Which Shure mics would you recommend?


Answer:

	We doubt that a different microphone would help. We suggest that your singer consider voice lessons to strengthen her voice.
	
	Heres an analogy. If you have a little 4 cylinder, 100 horsepower car, it doesnt matter what kind of tires you put on it, it still wont be a race car.
	
	In general, a condenser mic will likely work best for her, such as the KSM9 or Beta 87.
