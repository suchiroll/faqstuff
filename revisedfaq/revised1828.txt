Title: Replacement cartridge for Pioneer PL-510A turntable
Id: 1828
Legacy Id: 1888

Question:
I have a Pioneer PL-510A turntable serial number wh19456. I am not sure of the proper nomenclature for what I need but it is the assembly on the end of the phonograph arm that rides on the record. I am not sure if it is a needle or a cartdrige. there is a nut that twists on the arm and attaches the cartdridge to the arm there with electric contacts (4) there. I had bought a brand new one several years ago but it seems to have gone missing now. Please help me figure out what I need and how to find it. I also would be interested in finding a plastic dust cover that covers the turn table as well if you have one or know where to find it.
