Title: Value of 51 discontinued model
Id: 1836
Legacy Id: 1896

Question:
I have an old wired microphone (it is a model 51-the discontinued one) and I was wondering how much I could probably sell it for. I don't really need it and it is in great shape.


Answer:

	Shure does not buy old microphones and therefore we cannot tell you its value. Please see the following:
