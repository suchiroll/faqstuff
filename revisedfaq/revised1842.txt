Title: Replacement for M24H Quadraphonic cartridge
Id: 1842
Legacy Id: 1902

Question:
We are after one piece of M24H Phonograph Cartridge complete with stylus for our Yamaha discreet 4 channel record player. We understand M24H has been discontinued.


Answer:

	We wish we could help. Assuming you want to play 4 channel Quadraphonic records, you need a cartridge that can respond up to 40,000 Hz. We know of no companies that still make a Quadraphonic cartridge like the M24H.
	
	If you do not require a Quadraphonic cartridge, then we suggest the Shure M97xE as an equivalent performance cartridge.
