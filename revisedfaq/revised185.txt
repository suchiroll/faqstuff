Question:
What kind of wireless system should I use if I play bass guitar?


Answer:

	For bass guitar, we recommend the QLXD, ULXD, PGXD, or GLXD system. These digital systems have excellent frequency response for bass or guitar.

	

	However, make certain to audition any wireless system before you buy it. Try it out with your bass and your amp to make certain it provides the sound quality you want.
