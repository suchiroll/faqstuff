Title: Foam material for a 55SH
Id: 1851
Legacy Id: 1911

Question:
Hello, I called today asking where I could get the foam material to refurbish an old 55SH.  I was referred to Jim Steele in Georgia.  He said he though you might be more able to help me find that material.  I would guess that it is the same material that is in the new reissue (55SH series 2?).  Thanks in advance for your help.
