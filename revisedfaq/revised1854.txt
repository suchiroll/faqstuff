If the VR116L is not compatible can you suggest a microphone

that will be suitable for this soundcard and voice recognition, to

stand on a desk?


Thanks

Answer:

	At 10/11/2001 07:49 AM we wrote - Based on the incomplete specs supplied by the soundcard manufacturer, we believe the VR116L will not work properly. Typical of most soundcards, this soundcard requires a much stronger input level that a professional microphone can supply.
	
	So, we suggest the purchase of the Audio Buddy:
	
	This great preamplifier is the universal translator between the world of professional audio and the un-organized world of soundcards. With the Audio Buddy, you can choose any professional mic from Shure (or another company) that you like and the Audio Buddy will act as the interface into the soundcard.
	
	Why dont the soundcard makers design their microphone inputs to match professional microphones? We wish we knew!
