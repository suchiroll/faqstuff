Question:
Can you tell me how to aux send and aux return effects on this unit?




Answer:

	A post-Master/pre-EQ aux send can be obtained at the Mix Output (Com Mix) jack.
	
	The Aux Return can be inserted into the EQ Input jack. Note this is a switching jack and disconnects the internal signal path when a phone plug is inserted.
