Title: Difference between V15 III, V15 IV, V15 V

Question:
I have a V15 type IV that I purchased in the late 70s. The diamond fell off of the stylus arm. Until I could afford a new stylus, I replaced the whole cartridge with an old one and packed the V15 away. Now many years later I found it again. Is a replacment stylus available? And what is the difference between the one I have and the type III and type V? Is the type IV still being sold today? Many thanks!!!

Thanks very much!!! Since the exact type IV stylus is no longer available, will a type III or type V stylus fit in my type IV cartridge? Will I be losing much by not using the original stylus part number?


Answer:

	Is a replacment stylus available for the V15 IV?
	* Shure no longer sell a V15 IV stylus. Check Radio Shack; and Record King in New Jersey: phone 201-488-4232. Also do a web search using phonograph stylus.
	
	And what is the difference between the models?
	* The V15 III did not have the dynamic stabilizer/brush. The V15 V has the dynamic stabilizer/brush and has better trackability than the V15 IV.
	
	Is the V15 IV still being sold today?
	* No. It was last sold in the late 1980s.

	* The VN35MR will fit the V15 IV body.
	
	A nice upgrade from the V15IV without spending too much is the M97xE cartridge.
