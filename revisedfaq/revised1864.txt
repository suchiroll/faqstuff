Question:
We are in need of a condenser type mic to use for several things. (1) We have a stage (25' by 25') that needs mic'd for plays. (2) 3-vocalist that are spaced about 2'-3' apart. (3) Piano and woodwinds, sax, flute. I know that is a general field to cover. Would the SM81 be a good choice for that?


Answer:

	Yes, the SM81 would be a superb choice.
	1. Make certain the vocalists do not hold the SM81; it is designed for stand mount use.
	2. Consider mounting the SM81 with an A53M shock mount to reduce vibrational noise.
	3. The SM81 requires phantom power from the mixing board; make certain the board has phantom.
	
	Also consider the new Beta 27 in the same price range.
	
	In a lower price range, consider the SM94 and PG81.
