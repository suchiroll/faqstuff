Question:
I have recently been put in charge of the sound system at church? They wanted me to check into getting a couple of choir mics to hook up to our sound system. Someone had already purchased (2) audio technica choir mics, and they did not work. I don't want to make the same mistake. I am interested in the Microflex MX202. Are they compatible with any sound system? Is there a certain distance limitation to how long the cable can be?


Answer:

	The Audio Technica choir mics require phantom power to operate, as do the Shure MX202 mics.
	
	1. If your Crate powered mixer has phantom power, turn it on and your choir mics will work.
	
	2. If the Crate does not have phantom power, add a phantom power supply.
	
	Dont buy anything new until you get the Audio Technica mics to work.
