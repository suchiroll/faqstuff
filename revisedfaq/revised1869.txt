Question:
I am looking for an extension cable to fit the Shure Model 450 Series II microphone. I need a cord approx. 20 ft long.


Answer:

	The 450 microphone comes from us with a 7 foot attached cable that has no connector on it.
	If your microphone still has no connector on it, then you can purchase additional cable from any cable supplier (www.markertek.com).
	If you are looking for a longer coil cord to replace the one that came on it, contact Philmore Electronics at 815-874-2301.
	If someone put a connector on your microphone, you will need to find out what type of connector it is. If it's a 3-pin XLR connector, then you can purchase an C25J cable from our Shure Parts at 800-516-2525.
	If the microphone has a connector other than a 3-pin XLR, then you might want to try Markertek to see if they have an extension cable for you.
