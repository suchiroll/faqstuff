Question:
Greetings. I own 17 SM58 microphones, and about a dozen SM57's. I swear by them. They're road weary but keep on working flawlessly. I do have one SM58 that is missing the windscreen foam, just underneath the wire mesh ball. How can I get a new foam insert for this mic??


Answer:

	The part you are looking for is a replacement grill, model RK143G. The foam insert is not sold separately. Replacement grills can be purchased from our Parts Department at 800-516-2525.
