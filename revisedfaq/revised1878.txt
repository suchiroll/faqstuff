Question:
I'm a beatboxer looking for a good mic. I need it to pick up the bass from my throat as well as the blowing and beating sounds from my lips.


Answer:

	I need it to pick up the bass from my throat
	* Microphones respond to air movement, not to surface vibration like at the throat. This requires a vibration pickup like used on the top of an acoustic guitar. Search the web for manufacturers of piezo-electric pickups.
	
	...as well as the blowing and beating sounds from my lips.
	* Check out the microphone models BETA 58A or SM58.
