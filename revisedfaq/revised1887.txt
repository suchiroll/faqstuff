Question:
Our TV station has a Shure VP88 Stereo mic and there is some question here about how to position the mic facing the sound source. Do you aim it at the source like you would a SM58 or is it positioned straight up and down like a side address mic?


Answer:

	Aim the VP88 like an SM58. The VP88 is not a side address microphone. The circular end of the VP88 is the entry for the sound.
