Question:
We have a Shure SM58 wireless mic with an LX4 receiver. I need to hook it into a line input on a Mackie mixer. I presume that I can either use a XLR to 1/4 inch adaptor on the XLR output from the receiver and set the switch on the back of the unit to "line" OR I can use the 1/4 inch output on the back of the unit instead of the XLR output.


1. Are my assumptions correct?

2. If so, is one method in any way "better" than the other?


Answer:

	1. Your assumptions are correct.
	
	2. The XLR output is a lower impedance and will deliver a bit more signal level to the Mackie.
