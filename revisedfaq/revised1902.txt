Title: Repair of model 55S
Id: 1902

Question:
I HAVE A SHURE 55S MICROPHONE. IT'S SIGNAL HAS BECOME VERY WEAK. A FRIEND OF MINE HAD ONE THAT HE HAD REPAIRED YEARS AGO. HE SAID THERE IS A CRYSTAL IN THE MIC THAT GOES BAD. I'M WONDERING IF THIS CAN STILL BE FIXED.

ALSO IT HAS A THREE PRONG CORD CONNECTION THAT IS NOT A CANNON PLUG. CAN THIS BE CONVERTED TO A CANNON PLUG? IF NOT, CAN I ORDER A MALE CONNECTOR TO FIT, AS I LOST THE ORIGINAL PLUG AND CORD.


Answer:

	1)HE SAID THERE IS A CRYSTAL IN THE MIC THAT GOES BAD.
	* This is incorrect. There is no crystal in the 55S.
	
	2) I'M WONDERING IF THIS CAN STILL BE FIXED.
	* Shure no longer repairs the 55S as it was discontinued over 20 years ago.
	
	3) ALSO IT HAS A THREE PRONG CORD CONNECTION THAT IS NOT A CANNON PLUG.
	* It is called an Amphenol connector.
	
	4) CAN THIS BE CONVERTED TO A CANNON PLUG?
	* No.
	
	5) IF NOT, CAN I ORDER A MALE CONNECTOR TO FIT, AS I LOST THE ORIGINAL PLUG AND CORD.
	* Contact Tom Ellis Vintage Microphones at: tomsmics@flexcomp.com
	
	6) IF REPAIR IS POSSIBLE, PLEASE GIVE ME ADDRESS, AND INFO OF WHERE TO SEND IT.
	* Shure cannot repair it. Tom Ellis may be able to, or may have a source.
