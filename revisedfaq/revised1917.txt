Title: Mics for a French country and western band
Id: 1917
Legacy Id: 1978

Question:
I have recently starting playing live in a country and western band in France. We find it difficult to talk with sound engineers when they ask us what we need. We keep hearing about SM58 and SM57. Would you have a "standard" technical sheet we could use as a model and then hand over to concert organizers so they know what we need to be heard and hear ourselves on stage?FYI we are a 4-person band : 2 voices, 3 guitars and drums. Thank you for your time.


Answer:

	The Shure agent in France will have a technical sheet like you want, and in French.
