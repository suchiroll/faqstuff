Question:
I have a four track Tascam recorder. I play acoustic music with my friends. I usally plug my Taylor guitar directly into the recorder and have a Shure SM58 for the voice recording. My question is, what would be a good mic to set up in the room to pick up the unplugged instruments. These instruments are usually a violin, or a resonator guitar.


Answer:

	If you want one mic to set in the center of the room, and pick up in all directions, you will require a mic with an omnidirectional pattern.  The SM63 is an omnidirectional dynamic mic that will work well.
	
	Or you can use the KSM44 set to OMNI.
