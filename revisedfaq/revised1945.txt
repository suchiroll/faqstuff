Question:
I recently bought a Shure 556S, and was trying to figure out when the microphone was made. The serial number is 9041V. Is there any way to get a ballpark birth-year??


Answer:

	The mic was made from 1951 until 1981. The serial number does not help. It is simply a manufacturing lot number; it does not designate the year of manufacture.
