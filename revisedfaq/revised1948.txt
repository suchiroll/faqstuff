	Which phono cartridge will fit my turntable?
	
	The replacement stylus was the N110HE. It is no longer made by Shure, and Shure Parts no longer has stock. You might be able to find it in inventory at a replacement stylus specialist. One example is Record King: http://www.therecordking.com
	
	An equivalent replacement cartridge would be the M92E.
