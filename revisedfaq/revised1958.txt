Question:
I am engineering a recording at a clients studio, using a KSM32 for recording (pretty darn near everything!) and am using the A32SM for the mic. The elastic band has become very 'stretched-out' and I would like to know about getting a replacement band for it. Thank you for your time and thank you for such great products.

	For replacement parts, please contact our Parts Department at 800-516-2525.
