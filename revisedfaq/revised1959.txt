Question:
I currently am using your LX2 Beta 58. I tend to play hard and have beer, sweat, shots in the on/off and mute buttons. I can turn them on and off but it is very difficult. I'm wondering what the best way to clean the switches?


Answer:

	We highly recommend products from CAIG Labs: www.caig.com Or call them at 619-486-8388. They will help you select the proper type of switch cleaning product for your situation. You might want to also consider using the WA555 switch cover to help keep stuff out of the switches.
