Question:
I have a M75D cartridge. The stylus should be N71M-B. I can't find it in your list. Can I get that stylus anywhere? If not, is there a replacement stylus I can use?


Answer:

	The N71M-B stylus is no longer available. The N75B Type 2 stylus will fit the M75D and is still available from Shure.
