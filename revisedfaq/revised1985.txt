Question:
I would like to try to mike a violin using a wireless mic-----what do you recommend?

Answer:

	Put the mic on the violinist, not the violin. Experiment with positioning.
	
	Try the WL93 mic or the MX150B/O-TQG mic.  Both are available with the proper connector to mate with a Shure transmitter that has a TQG connector.
