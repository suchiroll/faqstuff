Question:
I own a SL-D202 Technics turntable. I had great success with another inexpensive technics turntable by using a Shure V15-V-P cartridge. The SL-D202 turntable is a different type of mount. I believe it is an S mount.


Is there a cartridge model that you would recommend that is of similar quality to the V15 v-p (p mount), only in an S mount?


Answer:

	Which phono cartridge will fit my turntable?
