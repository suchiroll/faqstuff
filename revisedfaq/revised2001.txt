Id: 2001

Question:
I have three SM588SD microphones which I purchased for use with my sound system that is used for live performances mostly in churches.

What is the difference between my mics and the SM58?

I read the label band wrong. It reads 588SD Unisphere B.

Thanks!!


Answer:

	Shure has never made a model SM588SD. Please recheck this model number carefully and contact us again.
	
	At 11/13/2001 09:27 AM we wrote - The SM58 is a better microphone for the following reasons:
	
	1. Extended frequency response (more low end and more high end)
	2. Better shock mount (less handling noise)
	3. More consistent polar pattern (more resistant to feedback)
	
	The 588SD has two advantages over the SM58:
	
	1. An on/off switch
	2. Dual impedance
