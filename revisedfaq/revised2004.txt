Question:
I bought a Shure Wireless Guitar system, and it works great, but my guitar 's 1/4 " plug-in is on the face of the instrument and my 1/4" plug from the transmitter sticks out from it. Do you have a guitar cord with a 1/4" plug that has a 90ยบ angle (L shaped). Is there any such animal?


Answer:

	Yes, its a WA304. You can order one from our Parts Department at 800-516-2525.
