Question:
At one time you sold what would be considered and ambibicial cable for the out side of your field mixer.

This cable combo provided XLR out-to XLR in to a tape deck or the back of a camera or any other source, and it also had a mini-plug for the monitor out to a camera in monitor jack (mini plug) so that the camera person could monitor what was going to tape. I don't remember what the length of this cable was but it was neatly wrapped and shielded and could remain attached to the mixer for quick set-up. DO YOU STILL CARRY THIS PRODUCT , OR DO YOU CARRY ANYTHING LIKE IT. PLEASE SAY YOU DO. IT IS A GREAT PIECE OF HARDWARE THAT FITS WELL WITH A GREAT FIELD MIXER. I USE THEM ALOT AND LOVE THE FP33.
