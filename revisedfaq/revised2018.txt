Question:
I am interested in the 55SH Series II Microphone. I need to know a couple of things before I decide to buy it. I need to know what kind of mic stand it needs, not a desk stand, a regular mic stand, and do you sell that. And also what kind of mic cord does it need, and do you sell that as well? Thank you for your help.


Answer:

	Mic floor stand is Shure MS10C. Mic cable is Shure C25F (25 feet with an XLR connector on both ends.)
