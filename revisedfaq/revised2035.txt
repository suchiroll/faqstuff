Question:
We have a wireless LX system that includes a lapel and a room mic going to a mixer. The output is wired mini-plug out that goes to the camera. Do you have a transmitter/receiver combo that could take that output and go wireless to the camera? It would be nice to move away from the receiver/mixer setup.


Answer:

	If the mixer has a mic level output, it can feed a Shure bodypack transmitter that will transmit to a Shure receiver positioned near thecamera.
