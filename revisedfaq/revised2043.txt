Question:
The user guide of the 55SH II states that the case is made of “Chrome–plated die casting”. I presume this is a METAL casting, but I realise that it may also be plastic, or arguably even chocolate :-) Please confirm. What is the nature of the case: would it rather dent than crack, should the microphone be subjected to high enough impact?


Answer:
The 55SH Series II housing is metal; it is diecast zinc. If the housing is subjected to excessive abuse, it will crack, not dent.
