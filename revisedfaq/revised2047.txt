Question:
I currently play blues harmonica using a Shure Green Bullet, usually thru a Fender Blues Jr. amp. I recently bought the above unidyne mike. What is the difference between that mike and the one Paul Butterfield used-the 565S unisphere I?


Answer:

	There is quite a bit of difference. The model is 565 is a close cousin of the model SM58. Either model is a high-end dynamic mic. The PE515 is a close cousin of the model 515. Either model is an entry level dynamic mic.
	
	Compared to the 565, the PE515 will:
	1) Have less low end
	2) Have less high end
	3) Will feedback easier
