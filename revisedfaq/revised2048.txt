Question:
I have decided to start and use my old Goldring Lenco 75 deck, fitted with a Shure M55E cartridge. The styli is worn however but I have seen a photo of a N75E styli on the net and the shape looks the same, will this fit my M55E cartridge? Hope you can help.


Answer:

	The N75E will not work properly.
	
	The N55E stylus is the proper stylus for your M55E cartridge.
