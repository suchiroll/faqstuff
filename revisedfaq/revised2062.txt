Question:
I've got a Vintage Gerrard 42M turntable with a Shure 75 EC cartridge that i believe needs servicing or replacing. The cartridge that I have says "SHURE M75EC5" on the bottom of it.


Can you advise me on what to do?


Attached is a photo of the cartridge, if it helps at all.


Thanks much.


Answer:

	We suggest that you replace the cartridge as it is over 20 years old.
	
	We suggest the M92E.
