Question:
Can I connect a remote volume control and assign it to control what ever input or output level that I choose, and cause that selected input/output to be different whith each preset?


Answer:

	Yes. This is all done in the Control Pin Configuration window.
	
	For example, in preset 1, you can have the volume control effect inputs 1 and 2. In preset number 2, you can have the same volume control effect outputs 3 and 6, instead, etc.
