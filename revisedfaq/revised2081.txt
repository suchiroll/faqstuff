Question:
Do you still make a microphone-like oscillator? I used to have a Shure oscillator that had a male XLR connector, looked like a small consdenser mike, and had a single tone, mic level audio output. Good for checking mike lines and VU meter levels. I lost mine, and wonder if you still make one like it.


Answer:

	Yes. It is the A15TG.
