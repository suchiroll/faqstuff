Question:
I have a UC wireless system with the rackmount and have one side so that I  can put the antennae on the front mount.  I didn't receive the other bracket with a kit that I purchased used.  Since I have all the required mounting and cabling, I wanted to see how much just the bulkhead BNC connector would cost or where I could purchase one of those.  Thanks.
