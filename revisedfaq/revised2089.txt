Question:
We have bought already 40 wireless microphones systems series UA and UB, both with handheld and bodypack! Recently we have had problems with the displays of both of them : handheld and bodypack. They don`t work at all! But the RF is OK!! We have 2 handhelds and 2 bodypacks.


Answer:

	The problem is the LCD display. The legs on some LCD displays are too short and they become disconnected from the PC board.
	
	This problem has been corrected in newer units.
