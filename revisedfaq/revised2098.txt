I am looking for a wireless mic system for my church's meeting hall that can seat about 450 people. It will be best if the system include 2 lavalier mics and 2 people can speak at the same time. Could you give me some suggestion and some price information? My church is locate at Irvine, CA 92606.

	1) Read: ht-tp://ww-w.shure.com/booklets/intro/intro_to_wireless.html
	
	2) Then read: ht-tp://ww-w.shure.com/pdf/booklets/church.pdf
	
	3) Then contact the Shure rep in southern California for assistance: ht-tp://ww-w.shure.com/scripts/dom_reps/bystate/california.asp#audiogeer
	
	Choosing and installing the correct wireless system requires detailed knowledge of sound system operation. The Shure rep, Audio Geer, will help you find such audio professionals in your area.
	
	As an example of a wireless system often used in churches, see: htt-p://ww-w.shure.com/wllxidx.html
	
	But this does not mean the LX Series is right for your church! It is only an example.
