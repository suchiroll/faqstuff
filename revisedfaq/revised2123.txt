Title: Linking FP24 to FP410
Id: 2123

Question:
Can I link or bus the FP24 into the FP410 (knowing of course the FP24 will not provide the auto gating of the FP410)? Does the link33 cable work with the FP410?


Answer:

	Sorry, it won't work. The FP410 link signal level and impedance is very different than the FP24 output. The FP410 "Mon In" jack can be modified (internally) to become a fifth input. The FP24 could feed into this jack.
