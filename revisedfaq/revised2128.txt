Question:
I have a N97HE w/ERA4 attached to a Technics direct drive turntable. Both were purchased in 1979. I have used them consistantly for an hour each day on average. How long is this cartridge and stylus suppose to last? The sound is still outstanding and I have not noticed any album problems. After 22 years I'm starting to wonder if I've set any performance records. Your product has been superb!!!


Answer:

	The cartridge body has no parts that wear out. The stylus has a typical life of 500 to 800 hours of playing time. Replacing the stylus assembly returns the phono cartridge to like new condition.
