Question:
I just received a replacement stylus VN35MR for my old V15 Type III. I noticed that the copperstylus housingis moderately tarnished. Will this effect performance? Should it be cleaned in some way before inserted into the cartridge?


Answer:

	The tarnish will have no effect on performance. Clean it at your own risk as you might damage the stylus shank during the cleaning process.
