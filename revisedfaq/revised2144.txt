Question:
I'm looking at wireless systems for an animated singer and it looks like the WCM16 is the better mic but which one stays on better?


Answer:

	Your question cannot be answered via email. The answer depends completely on the size and shape of the singers head.
	Trying on different headworn mics is the only solution. To find Shure dealers in your area, see: ht-tp://w-ww.shure.com/scripts/dom_reps/domfinder.asp
