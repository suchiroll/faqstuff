Question:
We would like to buy a mic for our radio station for round table discussions. In a booth with a 1 meter radius table, we would like to hang a mic from the ceiling that would pick up the voice of the guests. Which mic do you recommend for this purpose. Thanks in advance.



Answer:

	Consider the MX202 series. Note that this mic does require phantom power for operation.
	
	Please note that a mic that is 1 meter away from a talker sounds much different than a mic that is 1 cm away from a talker. And 1 cm is the typical distance used by radio announcers.
