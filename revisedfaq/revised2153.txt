Question:
How can I configure the P4800 to do a mono sub output?


Answer:

	Implement a mono subwoofer (or a 1 in, 1 out bandpass filter) using the Cut/Shelf block. The Cut filters contain all of the slope choices found in the crossover - from 6 to 24 dB per octave. Just set the frequencies of the low cut and the high cut filters and set the slopes.
