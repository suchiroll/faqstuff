Question:
Am I dreaming or is the old Shure 565 a pretty darn good sounding microphone? I replaced some nasty TOA mic with one and it sounded way obviously better, plus the user loved the excellent switch. Do you guys over there inside the company regard this as a better mike than people out here do?



Answer:

	The 565 is a very fine microphone. It is a Unidyne III design; the same design as the 545, the SM58 and the SM57.   For some reason, the model 565 is more popular outside of the United States.
