Question:
Hi. I have a few questions. I own a Shure PRO 8 (P-mount) phono cartridge that is being used on a Technics SL-DD33 turntable. I would like to know if I can obtain a replacement stylus for it? I believe it would be a model N104E.


Also are the replacement styluses that are obtainable from Radio Shack authentic Shure products (i.e. are they safe to use)?


Answer:

	1. The N104E will fit.
	
	2. Radio Shack buys authentic Shure styli and third part styli. Impossible to predict what you might get.
