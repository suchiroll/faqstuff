Question:
I would like to start a home studio using a upper-end condensor microphone to mic vocals and strings. I am interested in the KSM44 condensor microphone or possibly the KSM27 for studio and live performances.


1. I have a very powerful computer at home and I am wondering what I need to run a home studio besides a nice condensor microphone and computer?


2. What software do I need to run?


3. Do I need a mixer if I am running a condenser for vocals and instruments?


4. Are there home studio packages for sale with software and condensor microphone?


Answer:

	1. You will require a high quality microphone preamp with phantom power, like: http://www.rane.com/ms1b.html
	
	2. Shure does not make software for home recording. We do know that ProTools is a very popular program.
	
	3. You will need a mixer if you plan to use more than one microphone at a time.
	
	4. Cannot recommend package sales of home studios. Pick and choose the best equipment.
