Question:
I own a V15 Type IV cartridge. Can you send me the specs? I am trying to set-up the eq settings on my phono pre-amp and forgot the capacitance setting and output level of the cartridge.


Answer:

	Optimal capacitance load per channel: 200 to 300 picofarads in parallel with 47,000 ohms.
	Output level per channel: 4.0 mV; at 1,000 Hz, 5 cm/sec peak recorded velocity
