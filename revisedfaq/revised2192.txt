Question:
Some of your user guides state that the needle has a "nude" stylus. What is this? What are other methods of construction?


Answer:

	Nude stylus refers to mounting a diamond stylus into a hole in the stylus shank rather than a bushing on the stylus shank. The hole method provides slightly less mass than the bushing method. Less stylus mass translates to slightly better transient response. The mounting method is a minor component of overall performance.
