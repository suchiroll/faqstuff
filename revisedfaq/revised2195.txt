Question:
Among 78-lovers on the Internet the preferred pickup is often referred to as the discontinued M44/C with truncated styli from Expert Stylus in the UK.


Could you tell me what the sonical, mechanical and electrical differences are from the M44/C to the M75MB I use for 78 rpm records - along with a M78s I got hold of recently, because I was told it was impossible to get replacement 78 rpm styli for the M75.


Is it possible to use M44/C stylus on a M75? From photographs IÂ´ve seen, that they seem quite similar, while the the stylus from the M78s differ in several ways.


I like the sound from both M78s and M75 with 78 rpm stylus, and I have different lp styli also for the M75 - good for worn lp records.


But I need some special styli for some very old and abused records from around 1914. Here I need a much wider .0045 stylus, as provided by Expert Stylus. I could also use a .001 stylus for old mono lp's. Expert Stylus recommends the M44/C for the old lp's - not the M78s - not even with a compatible stylus.


I hope you have the enthusiasm to tell me the difference between the M75 and 44/C and give me an idea of why I should not use the M78s with a .001 stylus for the first lp records.


Will a M44/C stylus fit the M75?


Answer:

	The M44C has a .0007 inch radius, spherical stylus. It tracks at 3 to 5 grams. The output level is 9.5 millivolts per channel. The frequency response is 20 to 20,000 Hz. The replacement stylus is the N44C and it is available.
	
	The M75B has a .0006 inch radius, spherical stylus. It tracks at 1.5 to 3 grams. The output level is 5.0 millivolts per channel. The frequency response is 20 to 20,000 Hz. The replacement stylus is the N75B Type 2 and it is available
	
	The M78S cartridge has a .0025 inch radius, spherical stylus. It tracks at 1.5 to 3 grams. Note that this stylus radius is over 4 times the radius of the N44C.
	
	The recommended stylus radius for 78 rpm records is a minimum of .002 inch. A stylus tip of this size will not properly fit into an LP groove.
	
	The N44-C stylus will fit the M75 body.
