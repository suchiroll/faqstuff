Question:
I know I am a lot of years out of date, but; I have a Shure M44C cartridge which I have tried to use to play some 16" transcriptions I have - they are VERTICAL - it works, but; the stylus of course is designed for Microgroove work. Do you have a 2mil stylus(which as I remember is the correct one to do the above ) which will fit the 44C??


Answer:

	The N78S stylus will fit the M44C body with modification. The plastic stylus grip of the N78S is too tall; it hits the plastic body of the M44C. You must grind away the top 1/3 of the N78S stylus grip for it to fit.
