Question:
I have a Technics SL-J33 with a Shure P mount V15 cartridge. I am looking for the correct replacement stylus. I ordered a VN5MR but found this is not the correct item, as the P mount fitting is much smaller. Please provide me with the correct part number.


Answer:

	Assuming your product is the V15V-P, the correct stylus is the VN5P.
