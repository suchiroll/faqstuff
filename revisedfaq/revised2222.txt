Question:
I have a Shure cartridge from either the 70's or 80's, and I would like to find out what model it is so that I can replace the stylus. How can I do that, since I don't have the original product literature?


The part of the cartridge that holds the stylus is blue.


Answer:

	The stylus or the cartridge body should have a model number. If you cannot find a model number, send us a digital photo. Or send the phono cartridge back to Shure Service for identification.
