Question:
I was hoping you may be able to tell me which microphone model usedthe element identified as "Controlled Magnetic Transducer" Model 99N556. The element is also marked as Manufactured In Mexico. I was wondering if you'd also know the vintage. I'm guessing they may be relatively recent, possibly for a 520 series mic?


Answer:

	The 99N556 element was last made in 1994. It was an OEM element made for another manufacturer. It was not used in any microphone product that carried the Shure brand.
