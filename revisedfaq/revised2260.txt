Question:
Could you give me a list of mics that would be good for playing Chicago style blues?


Answer:

	To see what microphones we recommend for harmonica, see our online Selection Guide at:
	Which microphone should I use on ... ? (Selection Guides)
	We cannot tell you which one you will like best for your playing. Sound is subjective. Go to a Shure dealer and try them side by side.
