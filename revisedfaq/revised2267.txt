Question:
I have been useing this cartridge for many years in my home system. Finally ran out of stili-purchased many when new.


Answer:

	The M24H was designed for quadraphonic recordings. If you play quadraphonic LPs, you must continue to use the M24H. Sorry, Shure Serviceno longer has aninventory of N24H replacement styli.

	If you do not listen to quadraphonic LPs, we suggest you replace the M24H with a Shure M97xE.
