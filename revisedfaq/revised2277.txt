Question:
I have a home Recording studio using Shure microphones. I was reading your information on techniques for music for recording studios and on page 23 you listed a chart of instrument frequency ranges. This was only a partial list. I would like to know if you have or know where I can get a complete list of instruments with there frequency ranges?


Answer:

	The best source is a book called: Acoustics and the Performance of Music; Jrgen Meyer; 1978; ISBN 3-920-112-56-3. Sorry, it may be out of print. Try: www.alibris.com
