Question:
I am searching for a durable, quality microphone, preferably a directional microphone that can be used in non-studio applications such as live field recording. Can you recommend a microphone given a limited budget?


Answer:

	The VP64 or the SM63 is our choice. But both are omnidirectional. If you know for certain that the mic has to be directional, use the SM58.
