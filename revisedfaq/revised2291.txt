Question:
Hi, I don't know much about these in-ear-monitors, but how would they help prevent future hearing loss? Do they act as earplugs too? Are they too loud right up close to your ear? See my family has a history of hearing loss, and I hate using earplugs cause then I can't hear the music, so how would these help with that problem.


Answer:

	See page 6 (page 7 of the PDF) of the following booklet:
	
	Selection and Operation of Personal Monitor Systems
	
	Also page 12 and pages 25-26 have useful information.
