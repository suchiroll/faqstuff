Question:
Is the WL50 or WL51 available in beige color and as a headset mic? I want to use it for singing on stage with low visibility so the audience can't see the headset. And if so can I combine it with a wireless system?


Answer:

	1) Take a look at the Beta 53 or Beta 54.
	
	2) It is available in tan.
	
	3) The Beta 53 and 54 are designed to work with Shure wireless systems.
