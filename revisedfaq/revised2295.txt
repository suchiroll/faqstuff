Title: Wiring of MX392/C to Standard Male XLR Jack

Question:
I've got an MX392/C and I want to solder the wires to the correct pins of a standard Male XLR jack, (assuming this microphone doesn't need an in-line pre-amp?) maintaining the logic circuit functionality if possible. Since the MX392/C has 6 wires and an XLR jack has only 3 pins plus the lug, I'm assuming I have to double up wires to pins. Would this be the correct way to do it?


Pin 1 - shield and green wire

Pin 2 - red and white wires

Pin 3 - black and orange wires


If this isn't possible, will the microphone work with only the shield, red and black wires connected to the XLR jack?


Answer:

	The correct wiring is:
	Pin 1 - shield
	Pin 2 - red
	Pin 3 - black
	
	The mic will provide audio with this wiring, but it does require 11 to 52 volts of phantom power to operate.
	
	The other wires (green, white, orange) carry the logic signals. If you need these wires for external logic, use a six pin XLR connector.
