Question:
I need advice to know which Shure microphones to use for marimba, (live performance and live recording). There is going to be an international marimba festival in Chiapas, Mexico, and we are in charge of sound. We generally use Shure microphones but we would like if you know about the best set for marimba. I'd appreciate if you answer me as soon as possible because the festival will begin soon.
