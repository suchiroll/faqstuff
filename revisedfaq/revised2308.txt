Question:
I am a third grade teacher, in Florida. I have been teaching for 15 years and my voice has been severely strained. Someone told me about a system(not necessarily your company's) whereby the teacher used a wireless mike and had 4 speakers in the class. I really think that would be a wonderful thing for me and also for other teachers I know. Do you have any products that would serve the purpose of minimizing the effort needed to speak? The Beta 53 looked promising but I didn't know what kind of speakers it hooked up to and all the other details. Let me know what you may have.


Answer:

	We suggest you look at portable sound systems made by Yamaha, Anchor Audio, and other manufacturers.
