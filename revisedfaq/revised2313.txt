Title: V15 IV replacement stylus
Id: 2313
Legacy Id: 2399

Question:
Within the past two years I replaced my V15 IV with the same and one of my children has recently wrecked the stylus.

My enquiries reveal that the VN45HE stylus is no longer available. Is there another more recent stylus that I can use or do I just throw away a perfectly excellent cartridge?

Answer:

	The VN45HE is no longer manufactured by Shure.
	
	The VN35MR stylus will fit the V15 IV body and may still available via replacement styli dealers. Note that the VN35MR does not have the dynamic stabilizer/brush. A VN45 stylus is required to obtain the original performance of the V15 IV.
