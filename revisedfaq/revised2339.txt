Question:
I have a Shure M75 EJ Type 2 cartridge for which I need a stylus. Does Shure still make stylus's for this type of Cartridge? I know it's fairly old, but it's a nice cartridge and it would be a pity let it gather dust.

Answer:

	You can still obtain two styli for this model:
	
	N75ED Type 2 - biradial tip; 3/4 to 1.5 grams tracking
	
	N75B Type 2 - spherical tip; 1.5 to 3 grams tracking
