Question:
I recently found out I'm going to Australia and wanted to know if I can use an alternate power supply with my UC4-UB and my PSM 600 in ear monitor?


Answer:

	1) Simply use a 220V to 110V step-down transformer, and then connect your existing power supplies to it.
	
	2) The frequencies of your systems may not be legal in Austrialia. Send an email to the Shure agent in Australia listing the frequencies of your systems; they will advise you of the legality.
