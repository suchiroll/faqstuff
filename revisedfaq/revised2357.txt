Question:
I have a rather old system that has experienced very little phono use for some time. I recently acquired the ability to record and wish to put some of my "old" vinyl recordings on disc. I was surprised that, when attempting to play some records, there was absolutely no sound at all coming from the phono input. I have a relatively inexpensive Sony PS-FL7 II Automatic turntable. As I remember a while back, the sound was becoming much less dynamic and I began to not listen to my record collection at all. I would like to know if my problem could be a completely "dead" cartridge and, if so, which Shure Cartridge would you recommend to purchase. I did try to connect the phono to a Pioneer 757 integrated amplifier with no luck - absolutely no sound.


Answer:

	The problem could be the cartrdige, but more likely is corrosion in the electrical connections. Clean every electrical connection starting at the cartridge and working toward the receiver.
