Question:
I have an old OLD heathkit turntable with a now-discontinued M95ED cartridge. The direct replacement is an N95ED, but I have some questions:


1- Will the N95ED accommodate a wide stylus for 78 rpm records?

2- If so, what is the cost of such a stylus?

3- If not, is there a crossover cartridge that will fit in place of the discontinued M95ED that WILL accomodate a wide stylus, and

4- If there is such a crossover cartridge, what is its designation and the designation of the wide stylus?


Answer:

	1- Will the N95ED accommodate a wide stylus for 78 rpm records?
	* The N78S stylus for 78RPM records will fit IF you own a file or Dremel drill. The plastic grip on the stylus needs to be shaved down by less than one millimeter to make it fit the M95 body.
	
	2- If so, what is the cost of such a stylus?
	* The U.S. retail is $40.00 (October 2008)
	
	3- If not, is there a crossover cartridge that will fit in place of the discontinued M95ED that WILL accommodate a wide stylus?
	* We would suggest the M97xE as a replacement for the M95ED.
	
	4- If there is such a crossover cartridge, what is its designation and the designation of the wide stylus?
	* The N78S fits the M97xE body.
