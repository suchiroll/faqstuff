Id: 2375
Legacy Id: 2466

Question:
I have a Technics SL-D2 turntable which was in my closet for the past 15 years. I am thinking to modify it and to change the cartridge. I am looking for a Shure cartridge. My friend recommended the M75, which apparently was obsolete. I went to your website and noticed that there is a lot of different models.


Answer:

	Which photo cartridge will fit my turntable?
