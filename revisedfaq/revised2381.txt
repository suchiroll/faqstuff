Question:
I have a Telex receiver and transmitter with TA4F connectors, but a Shure headset mic to TA4F and a Shure 1/4" to TA4F that don't work with the receiver/transmitter; any ideas why?


Answer:

	On Shure transmitters, pin 2 is bias and pin 3 is audio.

	On Telex transmitters, pin 2 is audio and pin 3 is bias.
