Question:
Why is the FP42 not listed as a "Field Mixer"? Is there anything that would make this undesireable as a portable field mixer for video?


Answer:

	1) Most customers today consider the term "field mixer" to be a device small enough to hang around one's neck. The FP42 is too large.
	
	2) The FP42 is a mid-1980's circuit design and is not as quiet as the FP33 or FP24 or M367.
	
	There are no other reasons the FP42 cannot be used for field video production.
