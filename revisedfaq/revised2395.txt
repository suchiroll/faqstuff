Question:
I am trying to find a shotgun microphone for both indoor use and outdoor. I have been reading about the SM89, but the SM89 was not designed for outdoor use, only indoor. Can you point me in the right direction?

Answer:

	Where did you read that the SM89 cannot be used outdoors? This mic is commonly used by film and news crews around the world for outdoor recording.
	
	The SM89 will require proper windscreens if used outdoors. One source for specialized windscreens is Rycote.
