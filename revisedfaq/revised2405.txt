Question:
I have an old (1987) Shure V15HR-P cartridge, which was installed in a Sony PS-LX430 turntable arm. It is described as having a 'standardized plug-in' cartridge mounting.


1. Is your stylus N92E the proper replacement stylus for this cartridge? If not, is a replacement available?


2. Is this mount what was then called the P mount?


3. Can you email me the original specs for this cartridge so I can choose a new Shure cartridge if I cannot replace the stylus?


Answer:

	1. Is your stylus N92E the proper replacement stylus for this cartridge?
