Question:
I have designed a job where I plan on linking two SCM810 auto mixers and need to know the following:


1) By using the link out / in put option, do I avoid having to use one of the 8 input channels?


2) What type of cable do I need? (With the second unit mounted directly under the first)


3) Will these two units work as one 16 channel unit?


Answer:

	1) Yes. All eight input on both mixer will be available.
	
	2) A linking cable is supplied with every SCM810. If you buy two mixers, you will have an extra linking cable.
	
	3) Yes.
