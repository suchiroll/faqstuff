Question:
I had a question about age of the product. I have an old 55S, but can't seem to determine what year it was manufactured. Also, there seems to be a difference in models produced from 1951-1971 and those produced after 1971. What is the difference? When was the line discontinued?


Answer:

	
	There is no definitive way to determine the year of manufacture nor does Shure offer that service.
	
	There is no definitive list of the product differences over the years.
	
	The model 55SH Series II is still made.
	
	The model 55S was last sold in 1978 for $84; first sold in 1951 for $72.
	
	View the data sheet here: http://pubs.shure.com/view/guide/Model-55S-1951/en-US.pdf
	
	Shure does not offer opinions on the values of vintage microphones. Value is determined by the collectors willing to buy the mic.
