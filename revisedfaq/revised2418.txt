Question:
I have a R47XT cartridge that I would like to try and locate a stylus for. I'm sure you no longer carry a stylus that will work, but can you tell me what styus/replacement stylus were used in this cartridge? If I know that it might be possible to track one down. I found the specs in another faq, when was this cartridge introduced and when discontinued?


Answer:

	The styli that fit the R47XT were the RX5 and the RX8. If Radio Shack no longer carries these styli, the Shure NE95ED stylus will fit.
	
	Sorry, we have no records on when the R47XT was introduced and discontinued. Maintenance of such a record is the responsibility of the company that sold the cartridge: Radio Shack. We suggest you contact them.
	
	Shure did not sell or distribute the R47XT. We were an OEM supplier to Radio Shack. All sales and marketing issues were/are the responsibility of Radio Shack.
	
	If you want to replace the Radio Shack R47XT, consider a Shure M97xE.
