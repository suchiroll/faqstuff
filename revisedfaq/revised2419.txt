Question:
I'm considering the internet purchase of a Shure C50J microphone cable. I was thinking this might be a good match with my Shure SM48 microphone. But I having trouble finding specifics for the cable. Your website provided the length (50 ft.) but I'm also interested in knowing the gauge, number of conductors, shielding. etc. before I buy it.


Answer:

	The C50J is an inexpensive cable. It has two inner conductors of 22 gauge. The shielding is a spiral wrap with about 85% coverage.
	
	If you are looking for a 50 foot cable that will last a lifetime, the C50J is not the answer.
