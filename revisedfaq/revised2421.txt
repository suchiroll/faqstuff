Question:
Do you make a wireless mic that can withstand some water. I work at a zoo, and we have several wireless mics. One of them is used when the keepers wash the horses, water gets every where. Do you sell any water proof products?


Answer:

	There are waterproof cases that fit wireless transmitters.www.aquapac.net
	
	For the mic, try using a dynamic headworn mic like the WH20. Not waterproof, but definitely water-resistant.
