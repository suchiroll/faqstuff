Question:
I would like to make an order of Shure phono-cartridges. But first I need to determine which type best suits my purpose. I hope that you can help answer some questions.


I do preservation re-recording work with historic recordings -- Edison cylinder records made during the years 1888 - 1920s. These records have grooves that are much wider than 33-1/3 LPs. The groove widths vary depending on type of record, but many are as large as 13 mil. Also, the groove information is cut vertically, with no lateral audio signal.


In order to play these recordings, I will also make an order of custom-made, large-size styli from a company in England called Expert Stylus Company. They can provide custom-sized styli mounted on Shure stylus holders -- either Shure N44/C type or Shure SS35C type.


According to this company, the Shure M44 cartridge is the best for playback of Edison cylinder records. However, they say that the M44 cartridge is no longer available. As a second-best choice, they recommend the Shure SC35C cartridge.


On the M44, the Expert Stylus Company says in their information: "This particular cartridge we feel is by far the best for both lateral and vertical cut recordings. The compliance elastomer allows the cantilever to move very freely in the vertical and lateral planes at tracking weights from 1.50/6.00 grams."


I see that Shure does currently offer the M44/7 and M44/G. So, here are my questions:


1.) Minus the stylus -- is this the same cartridge as recommended by the Expert Stylus Company?


2.) If you take away the stylus, are the M44/7 and M44/G exactly the same design?


3.) Should I order the M44/7 or M44/G to go with the Expert Stylus Company's custom styli?


Answer:

	The N44C stylus fits the M44G body and the M44-7 body. Either body is the same.
	
	We suggest take whatever advice Expert Stylus provides. They know their business regarding the playback of Edison cylinders.
