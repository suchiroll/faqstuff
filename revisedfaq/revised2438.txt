Title: Connecting a Polycom to a Shure Mixer

Question:
I am interested in improving the mic coverage in several of our conference rooms at Cisco. Some rooms require ~4 additional microphones others might require upto ~8.


I asked a Polycom Engineer about their unbalanced RCA AUX I/O jack on their phones (really it's on their powersupply)  was told the following:


--

 Signal levels are the same for the AUX I/O jack on the

 SoundStation Wall Module, SoundStation Premier Wall

 Module, and the Satellite. "AC" refers to

 the frequencies between 200Hz and 3kHz.

 The following all refers to the AUX

 I/O signal unless otherwise stated.

 When acting as an input, the AC impedance is 20k.

 When acting as an output, the AC impedance is  500 ohms.

 The signal has a DC impedance of 36K to +15V. Because of

 this, we recommend that connections to AUX I/O be AC-coupled,

 and that any external capacitor polarity take account

 of this +15V bias. Path Gain, Input: 400 mV RMS (-5.7  dBm) at

 AUX I/O produces 480 mV (-4 dBm) RMS nominal at Tip/Ring into 600

 ohms Path Gain, Output: 340 mV RMS (-7 dBm) at Tip/Ring

 produces 400 mV RMS (-5.7 dBm) nominal at AUX I/OFor reference,

 saturation on the phone line is 0 dBm, maximum sustained

 signal generally allowable is about -9 dBm (which is very loud).


I also know [according to their web site] that their Preimer phone:

-has Automatic microphone mixing that intelligently directs one of three console microphones to whomever is speaking, and can switch among the mics up to 250 times per second, so not a word or nuance is missed.

-Dynamic noise reduction automatically adapts to background noise???

-full duplex capability adapts to the acoustic characteristics of any

room, with a separate echo canceller for each of its three console mics.


The question is, should do I need the SCM268,or should I spend the extra$ for a SCM410? Also should I even consider trying to hookup a SCM800 or an SCM810? Or should I forget using the Polycom phone  move to a higher end echocancelling Gentner AP400/AP800? e.g. Will I hear clipping  have poor intelligibility?



Answer:

	The question is, should do I need the SCM268,or should I spend the extra for a SCM410?
	* The SCM410 will provide better intelligibility because unused mics are attenuated. We feel it is worth the extra money.
	
	Also should I even consider trying to hookup a SCM800 or an SCM810?
	* Dont use the SCM800 - too many open mics. The SCM810 is just like the SCM410 but with more inputs. Do you require the additional inputs?
	
	Or should I forget using the Polycom phone  move to a higher end echocancelling Gentner AP400/AP800?
	* Suggest you ask Gentner or someone else that has a Gentner.
	
	Will I hear clipping  have poor intelligibility?
	* The Shure mixers will not clip syllables and they should improve intelligibility.
	
	
	Can I get a loaner to test it out before I buy one/some?
	* The local Shure rep may be helpful.
