Question:
I have several UB-band UHF wireless systems, and would like to share antennas. What is your recommendation on using the -UB versus -US distribution amplifiers? The -US appeals to me because it's possible I'll also have -UA systems in the future, and it would be nice to have one antenna distribution system instead of two. What do I give up for this flexibility.



Answer:

	The UA845-US is a wideband device. That means the RF filters on it are wide.

	The UA845-UB is a band limited device. The chance of interference is less when using a band limited device, versus when using a wideband device.
