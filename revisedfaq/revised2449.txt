Question:
I just wanted to know if I can put an N44-G replacement stylus on my M44-7 cartridge? Basically, I have the M44-7 and I want to try the sound output of the N44G. Can I try this with just replacing the stylus and not the whole cartridge?


Answer:

	The N44G replacement stylus will fit the M44-7 body.
