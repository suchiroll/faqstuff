Question:
1.- I have been told you have a ceiling mike that is retractable. If so what is the apperatus that does this and what are the vertical parameters of the ajustments.
2.- Do you have a wireless lapel or headset mike that is available with disposeable sterile covers or that is able to be sterilized.
3. Do you have a Microflex or wireless mike that will they work well with a gentner echo cancelation system and will they be suitable for use in an operating room which has a lot of E.M. noise and background noise.


Answer:

	1.- I have been told you have a ceiling mike that is retractable. If so what is the apperatus that does this and what are the vertical parameters of the adjustments.
	
	* The Shure MX202 mic can be purchased with a cable reel, but not from Shure.

	2.- Do you have a wireless lapel or headset mike that is available with disposeable sterile covers or that is able to be sterilized.
	
	* Disposable windscreens are available that are made of open-cell foam. They are not sterile.
	
	*We have no knowledgewhat procedures are used to sterlize devices, so we cannot comment if a mic can handle the sterilization process.
	
	
	3. Do you have a Microflex or wireless mike that will they work well with a Gentner echo cancelation system and will they be suitable for use in an operating room which has a lot of E.M. noise and background noise?
	
	* Any of the Microflex mics will work with Gentner products. E.M. noise can be a problem for ALL audio products. Experimentation in the room will be the key.
	
	* A microphone cannot distinquish between background noise and speech. The best option is to place the mic as close as possible to the talking source desired.
	
	* Advanced microphone arrays, coupled with sophisticated audio processing, can also be considered, however, room acoustics still have an enormous impact on the intelligibility of speech.
