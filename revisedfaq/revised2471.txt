Question:
I have a Shure microphone model PE50SP and I was just wondering if there are any replacement grilles that would fit this mic. I didn't see any for this particular model on your web site but it looks so much like an SM58 maybe it uses the same grille.


Answer:

	Yes, the SM58 replacement grill will fit the PE50SP.
