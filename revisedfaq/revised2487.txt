Question:
Is there any way to use my existing V15/Pro-S on a new Technics turntable with a P-mount?


Answer:

	There is no adapter available from Shure that converts a 1/2 mount V15/Pro-S cartridge to a P-mount cartridge.
	
	Have you asked Technics if they offer an adapter?
	
	Also, check: http://www.hollywooddj.com
	There may be a company that makes a universal adapter.
