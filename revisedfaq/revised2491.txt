Title: Replacement for Shure HW505A Mic

Question:
I understand that the Shure HW505A microphone has been discontinued. Can you tell me if there is a comparable replacement for that model? Our company uses these mics with a voice dictation system. The HW505A mic has been the best mic for our needs.


Answer:

	There is no direct Shure replacement. A Shure WH20XLR mic combined with a mic preamp will be close to the HW505A.
