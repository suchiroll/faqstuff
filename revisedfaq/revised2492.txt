Question:
I would like to buy a user guide for cartridge 1000E.


Answer:

	There is no user guide specifically for the 1000E. Perhaps these specs will help:

	
	Model 1000E
	Replacement stylus: N99E
	Tip type: Biradial (0.2x 0.7 mils)
	Other stylus that will fit: N104E
	Optimum tracking force:1 1/4 gram
	Similar current Shure model: M92E (0.4x 0.7mils) (TF: 3/4 to 1 1/2)
	
	If not, please send us specific questions and we will attempt to answer.
