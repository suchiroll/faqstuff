Question:
What amperage rating is the switch contact in the model 515?


Answer:

	The contacts on this switch are intended for use in low level/dry circuit applications. High current or voltage levels will shorten the contact life. The switch contact can handle up to one amp, but the contact life would be greatly shortened.
