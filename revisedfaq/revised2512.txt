Title: P4800 Latency
Id: 2512

Question:
What is the latency (group delay) from input to output with the P4800 in the signal path with no DSP resources assigned?


Answer:

	The propagation delay is less than 1.5 ms. The latency does not increase as you add processors to the signal path (unless of course it is a delay block or a Peak Stop limiter).
