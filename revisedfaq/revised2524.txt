Question:
I have a V15V cartridge purchased in the early 1980s. The stylus is missing. There is a stylus box, however, for a model N55E stylus packed with the original box for the cartridge. I think I used that stylus in the V15V, but am not sure.


Since the N55E is still available, and not as expensive as the VN5MR, will the N55E work in the V15V cartridge?


Answer:

	Our sample N55E did not fit into the V15V body.
