Question:
I have a courtroom application in which the judge would like the option of using his lavalier mic as a desk mic.. any suggestions would be much appreciated.



Answer:

	Lav mics made now are so small, it is impractical to use them as a desk mic. Look at the SM63 as a desk mic, and for possible use as a very large lav mic.
	
	To hold the SM63 as a lav mic, get a Mic-Nik from:
	Ametron

	(323) 464-1144 Phone
	(323) 871-0127 Fax.
