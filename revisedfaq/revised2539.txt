Question:
I came into a supply of boxes while cleaning out a relative's estate. The boxes say:


Controlled Magnetic Transducer

Shure Brothers, Inc.

Model No. 99K561 Q1


Can you tell me anything about what these are and how they were used?


Answer:

	The 99K561 transducer was used in the model TH41Y - a telephone-type handset made for the U.S. Government. The handset featured a noise-cancelling mic design, and a transistorized preamplifier.
	
	The 99K561 was discontinued in 1990.
