Question:
Could you let me know if is not completely insane to try a SM81 on my Electric Guitar Amp for recording? What should I take care of to do it and get good sound and without any damage for my SM81?


Answer:

	You will not damage the SM81 with high SPL, but it might produce a distorted signal.
	
	Suggestions:
	
	1. Use the 10 dB pad.
	
	2. Use the lo-cut filter in the steep position.
	
	3. Place the mic capsule at a 45 degree angle in relation to the speaker cone.
	
	4. Experiment with different mic positions and distances.
