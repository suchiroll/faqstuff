Question:
What is the difference between 48V Phantom  12V A-B Tonader power supplies??



Answer:

	48V Phantom: +48V on pins 2 and 3; return on pin 1
	
	12V A-B Tonader: +12V on pin 2; return on pin 3; no DC path on pin 1.
	
	These two schemes are very different and incompatible with each other.
