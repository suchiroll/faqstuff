Question:
I have a Shure 'Designer Series' phono cartridge in a nice presentation box complete with a stylus balance and mounting hardware. It doesn't have any model number on the cartridge or instruction leaflet. What the replacement stylus will be?


Answer:

	The current replacement stylus for your Designer cartridge is the NE95ED. Your model was similar to the discontinued ME95HE.
