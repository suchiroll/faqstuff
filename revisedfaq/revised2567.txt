Question:
The product spec sheet says I can use a dynamic lavalier with the LX1 bodypack. None of the mics listed (WL83, WL183, WL184, WL185) are dynamic. Can I use the SM11 with the LX1?


Answer:

	Yes, the SM11 will work with the LX1. Wire it as follows:
	
	SM11 pin 1 to LX1 pin1
	SM11 pin 2 to LX1 pin 3
	SM11 pin 3 to LX1 pin 1
