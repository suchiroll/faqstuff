Question:
The FP24 and the Sony PD150 DV Camera don't like each other. There is a strange distortion when I use the two together. Any ideas?


Answer:

	Yes. The Sony audio input circuit design is less than optimal. It does not operate well when fed by an output circuit that is impedance-balanced like the FP24.
	
	One solution is to insert a 600 ohm/600 ohm in-line isolation transformer between the FP24 output and the Sony input. Such a transformer available is the model ProCo ITX; available from: http://www.markertek.com
