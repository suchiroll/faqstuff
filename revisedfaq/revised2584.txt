Question:
I have a Shure W20R Wireless Microphone Receiver that seems to work quite well but I'm getting a bit of noise with it. I have no antennae to fit it! By any chance do you have something that would fit this older model and what could I do about getting one?


Answer:

	Sorry. We no longer have parts for the W20R. Try Telex in Minneapolis: phone 800-392-3497.
	
	The W20R was made by Telex for Shure, before Shure started manufacturing its own wireless receivers. The W20R was based on a standard Telex receiver.
	
	When you call Telex, ask for someone that worked there in the late 1980s or they may not know about this joint effort between Telex and Shure.
