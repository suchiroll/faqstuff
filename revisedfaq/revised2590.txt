Question:
Whenever I see a picture showing someone making a voice recording (such as voicing a cartoon character, looping for a movie, or reading text) I notice that they are using a large, spherical microphone. Is that just a big windscreen or is the microphone that big. What kind of microphone are they using. If you think it relates to a particular Shure product, which one?


Answer:

	You might be referring to the popper-stopper model PS-6 in front of the mic.

	
	Typical recording mics are the Shure KSM series.
