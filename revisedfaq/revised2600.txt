Question:
I need help with selecting a windscreen that will work for a special application. I record race car sounds. I need something that will work in an in-car application. There is alot of wind. What do you suggest?


Answer:

	1. Use an omnidirectional dynamic mic like the Shure SM63.
	
	2. Cover the SM63 head with the A81WS windscreen.
