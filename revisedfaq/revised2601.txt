Title: 78 rpm stylus for V15 III?
Id: 2601

Question:
Do you make a compatible stylus for 78rpm records that would fit my mark 3V15 cartridge?


What "weight" would it need for best results (I want to transcribe old 78's to CD and want to reduce the hiss from smaller stylii)


Answer:

	Shure no longer sells a 78 rpm stylus for the V15 III. Purchase the M78S cartridge. It is designed for 78 rpm and has the proper size stylus: 2.5 mils radius.
	
	This cartridge tracks from 1.5 to 3 grams.
