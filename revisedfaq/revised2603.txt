Title: Difference between controlled reluctance and controlled magnetic

Question:
I am very interested in finding out all that I can about controlled reluctance and controlled magnetic cartdiges for harmonica use. They both seem to have had several different model numbers over the years. I am told that controlled reluctance came first and controlled magnetic replaced it (?).


First, what's the technical difference(s) between "controlled reluctance" and "controlled magnetic"?


Second, how do the controlled reluctance and controlled magnetic elements vary sonically (between themselves and within their own type)?


Third, how do you identify the element's model number (ie, R5, etc) from the part number that is printed on the square beige canvas located on the rear of the element?


Answer:

	First, whats the technical difference(s) between controlled reluctance and controlled magnetic?
	* No difference. Different names for the same transduction principle.
	
	Second, how do the controlled reluctance and controlled magnetic elements vary sonically (between themselves and within their own type)?
	* There is no difference between the two. See above.
	
	Third, how do you identify the elements model number (ie, R5, etc) from the part number that is printed on the square beige canvas located on the rear of the element?
	* Best to ask this question of THE antique harmonic mic expert. Send an email to: tomsmics@flexcomp.com
