Title: FP33 Tape Out Isolation
Id: 2605

Question:
Is the Tape Out tied to the Main Outputs in any way or are they isolated?

i.e. If I take the Stereo Tape Out and tie the left & right together, external the mixer, to make a mono feed, will it affect the Main XLR Outputs of the Mixer. (I know the Tape out can be made mono with internal modifications, but do not want that option)


Answer:

	The tape out is resistively isolated from the main outs. Making the tape out a mono feed will not affect the FP33 main outs.
