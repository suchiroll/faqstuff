Question:
I am studying Media Technology, microphones are the topic at present, was wondering if you could help me with a question? What is the purpose of the equalizing hole in the capsule of an omnidirectional mic?


Answer:

	It is called a barometric leak. It equalizes the air pressure on both sides of the diaphragm. It serves the same function as the Eustachian tubes in the human ear.
