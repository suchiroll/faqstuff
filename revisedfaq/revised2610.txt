Question:
I have a Shure V15 Type III SuperTrackPlus cartridge (the casing looks like chrome) that I purchased in the early 80's. I've had it mounted in a Thorens TD-145 belt drive turntable since I purchased it, track at about 1.15 grams, and have replaced the stylus once. Other than stylus replacement, I'm wondering if are there any parts or components that wear out over time on the cartridge itself that might reduce the quality of the signal? Or, is a new stylus all that is required to keep the quality of the sounds at original specifications?


Answer:

	Only the stylus wears out. The cartridge body has no parts that deteriorate. A new stylus returns the product to like-new condition.
