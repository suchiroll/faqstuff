Question:
The PSM700 user guide in English on page 5 specifies for the Transmitter Input Connector, a 1/4-in phone and XLR(female), balanced. My questions is does the balanced apply to both the 1/4-in phone, and the XLR cables. I plan on using 1/4-in phone cables, and I want to know if I must used balanced or unbalanced.


Answer:

	XLR and 1/4" input are balanced. Use balanced cables whenever possible.
