Question:
I have an old Pioneer turntable with a Shure M175 cartridge. The stylus got broken and I would like to replace it, but is it so old that I really need to replace the whole cartridge? I love the way it sounded and would prefer to just replace the stylus but I can't even find a listing of that cartridge. Can you suggest a proper replacement stylus or comparable cartridge if styli are no longer available? I have mostly classical music or classic rock albums and my wife has mostly big band albums. Thank You in advance for your help and great products.


Answer:

	The replacement stylus is the NDC-HE. Or replace the entire cartridge with either the Shure M92E or the Shure M97xE.
