Question:
Is there a stylus checking gauge (microscope) available to check the condition of a stylus? Does Shure have one available?


Answer:

	Until 1980, Shure sold the SEK-2 microscope for stylus inspection. We no longer sell such a product.
	
	The SEK-2 was capable of 100 to 200 times enlargement of the stylus. It featured two lamps to illuminate the stylus and a stylus mounting block. You might find one on e-bay. Or use a microscope with similar specifications.
