Question:
Does the old PS1 power supply, not the PS1A, power a mic that requires 48 volts?


Answer:

	Neither will. The PS1 and the PS1A supply 20 volts of phantom. Shure does not sell a 48V phantom supply.
	
	Most Shure dealers will also carry 48V phantom power supplies made by other manufacturers.
