Question:
We currently have an LX system operating on 202.200 MHz. We would like to use a second receiver in a different location (same room) to pick up the audio from a single speaker/mic. Can a second LX4 receiver operating at 202.200 MHz be used with the original mic such that both LX4 receivers are picking up the transmit from a single mic, or do we need a totally seperate set up at a different frequency?


Answer:

	Yes, that works perfectly fine. Its just like multiple car radios listening to the same radio station.
