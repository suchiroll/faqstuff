Question:
I have several re-tipped N75 styli (different tip sizes for various 78 rpm records). Both my cartrdges are now over 20 years old - but are still working! I would like to buy a new Shure cartridge and want to know if my existing styli would fit any of your current cartridges.


Answer:

	Yes. The M44G or M44-7 body will accept the N75.
