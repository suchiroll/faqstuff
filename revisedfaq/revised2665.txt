Question:
I am trying to choose between the SM81 and KSM137 to mic a choir outdoors using sound reinforcement.
1) Which one would be the best to use?
2) What are the primary differences?
3) Which one would you use?



Answer:

	1) The KSM137 is quieter (less background hiss). 
	2) The self-noise level and the SPL clipping point.
	3) The KSM137 with the A81WS windscreen, and the A53M isolation mount.
