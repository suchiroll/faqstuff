Question:
I was thinking about switching the head on my LX wireless from an SM58 to a Beta 87A. Since the wired version of this mic uses phantom power, what powers the wireless version. In other words. Will it eat batteries faster?


Answer:

	The Beta 87A will not increase the battery drain. The interchangable mic capsules in the Shure wireless line all draw the same battery current....that is why they are interchangable!
