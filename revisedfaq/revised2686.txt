Question:
I have a wireless Beta 58 and have had it for about 6 months. Several sound engineers have told me that the capsule is not correct for my voice. They say it is accentuating the range I am already strong in and that I need a capsul that will give me more clarity and boost in the mid to lower ranges. Is the Beta 58 incorrect for my voice or could there be something wrong with my capsule? What capsule would you suggest for a 1st tenor?


Answer:

	Microphone selection is completely personal preference. Its similar to asking, Which is the correct color, red or green? Some people like the color red, and some people like the color green.
	
	Visit your local Shure dealer and try the different microphones to determine which microphone you like best. It will help to record your voice with the different microphones, so that you can listen to each while you are not singing.
