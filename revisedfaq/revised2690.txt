Question:
WE HAVE A COURTROOM UTILIZING THE AMS24 SYSTEM. HOWEVER THE GOOSENECK IS NOT LONG ENOUGH. CAN A STANDARD GOOSENECK WITH MALE THREADS ON ONE END AND FEMALE ON THE OTHER BE THREADED ONTO THE AMS GOOSENECK AND BASE TO EXTEND THE MIC? ARE THE THREADS COMPATABLE?


Answer:

	Here is the best method:
	
	1) Add the Shure A24QG to the end of the AMS24 gooseneck. This accessory makes the end of the AMS24 gooseneck into a male XLR connector.
	
	2) Neutrik offers thicker goosenecks, in black, with female XLR connectors on the end. Choose the Neutrik gooseneck with the desired length; install it and wire it; plug the AMS24 into the Neutrik gooseneck.
	
	3) You will need a thicker gooseneck at the base to support the weight of the AMS24.
