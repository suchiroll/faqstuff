Question:
Can I still get stylus for DC40?


Answer:

	The replacement stylus was the model SS40. The SS40 was a spherical tip that tracked at 2.5 to 3.5 grams.
	
	Shure no longer has inventory of the SS40.
	Try this vendor as it stocks many discontinued styli: http://garage-a-records.com
	
	Or you may replace the DC40 with the Shure M35X cartridge, a current model that has similar specs to the DC40. It may be purchased from: http://music1online.com/phoncar.html
