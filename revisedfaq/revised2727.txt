Question:
I use a fishman V-100 (that I've been happy with for years). I want to go wireless, but the input to the violin on a v-100 is an 1/8 inch that ends up as a 1/4 inch. Are there wireless systems that are compatible with this?


Answer:

	Here is a link to read BEFORE you go wireless. This link applies to violin as well as guitar.
	
	Guitar or bass: Should I use wireless?
	
	If you still decide to try wireless, send us the following info about the Fishman
	
	1. Output impedance in ohms.
	
	2. Average and maximum output level in millivolts.
	
	3. Powering requirements, if any.
	
	4. Wiring scheme of the output connector.
	
	These four important specs will determine if the Fishman will work properly with a Shure transmitter.
