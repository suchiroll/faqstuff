Question:
I have an old Ultra 500 cartridge that I have used since the late 80's. It has served me well, and I have replaced the stylus faithfully, first with the original replacement, then the VN5MR as recommended. My question is this: I know that cartridges have a limited life due to internal parts losing magnetism, rubber hardening, etc. Is there anyway if I were to send you this cartridge to have it refurbished as new? Also, what is the output (in Mv)on the Ultra 500?


Answer:

	* Replacing the stylus returns the cartridge to like-new condition. There is nothing to deteriorate inside the cartridge body.
	
	Also, what is the output (in Mv)on the Ultra 500?
	* 3.3mV
