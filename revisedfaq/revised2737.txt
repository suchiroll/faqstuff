Question:
Hi I am considering buying PG81 to record classic guitar to computer.
1) Is PG81 a good choice for Classic guitar, I know it is for acoustic?
2) I have Creative Live vakue sound card with the following spec.
*Mic Impedance 600 ohms
*Mic sensitivity 10-200 mvpp
*Noise floor -120db
*Signal to noise ratio 96 db
Will I need a transformer like A95UF to raise the signal or will it be ok also how do you rate the A/M noise floor according to standards?
3) Will the transformer (if any) will be enough to record a high signal or I will need a mixer?
4) if I need a mixer is 200M ok with my sound card and PG81?
5) last question is PG81 for live performance only or it is good as well for recording?



Answer:

	1) Yes, it is a good choice.
	
	2) The transformer will NOT provide enough gain
	
	3) We suggest a mic preamp with at least 60 dB of gain.  It must also have a low noise floor as classical guitar is a quiet instrument.
	
	4) The M200 mixer will be too noisy for classical guitar. Do NOT use the 200M.
	
	5) It will work fine for recording.
	
	Professional low impedance condenser microphones, like the PG81, have a low output level.  A dynamic low impedance mics, like the SM57 or SM58, has an even lower output level.   The sound card on your computer requires a hotter level.
