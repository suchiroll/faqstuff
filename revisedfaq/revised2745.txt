Question:
I have a few Shure FP410 Automixers that I recently purchased and the input gain is very high. I have a Shure MX184 wired lav into the mic level input and need to set the input knob on the FP410 to 1/2. A setting of One is too high! Similarly, a Beta 57 at normal speaking distance is set to around 2. Much different when compared side by side with the SCM810 Automixer. Do you have a modification for the phenomena?


Answer:

	The FP410 does have about 13 dB more gain than the SCM810.  Here are instructions on how to reduce the input gain of the FP410:
	
	What is the purpose of this modification?
	It reduces the gain of the initial input stage. This allows the input control to be set higher when using a microphone with a "hot" output. From the factory, this stage produces 14dB of gain.
	
	How is the FP410 modified?
	For channel one, resistor R140 (3kohm) is replaced with a new value.
	To reduce the gain by 6dB, use a 8.2kohm resistor. To reduce the gain by 8dB, use a 12kohm resistor.
	To reduce the gain by 10dB, use a 22kohm resistor. NOTE: The input stage could become unstable and oscillate when R140 is replaced. If this happens, try a resistor with a smaller value. Results will vary from mixer to mixer because of component tolerance. Experimentation will be necessary when modifying this gain stage.
	
	What are the steps?
	
		Remove the four screws which secure the FP410 cover.
	
		Look near the channel one XLR connector and locate R140 (3kohm).
	
		Remove R140. Replace it with the new value selected above.
	
		For input two, replace R146.
	
		For input three, replace R152.
	
		For input four, replace R158.
	
		Reassemble the FP410.

	Will Shure modify the mixer for me?
	Yes, for a nominal charge.
	Return the FP410 to the Shure Service Department

	Please include a copy of this bulletin.
	
	Is there another way?
	A Shure A15AS in-line attenuator may be inserted between the microphone and the FP410 input. The A15AS will provide 15, 20, or 25 dB of attenuation and will pass phantom power.
