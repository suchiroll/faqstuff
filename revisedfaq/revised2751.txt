Title: PSM transmitter antenna orientation
Id: 2751
Legacy Id: 2858

Question:
I noticed in the diagrams in the manual that the antenna on the transmitter is at an angle. Does it matter, and if so, what is the angle?


Answer:

	The angle of the transmitting antenna should match the angle of the receiving antenna.
	
	If you dont know the angle of the receiving antenna, place the transmitting antenna up 45 degrees from horizontal; it is a good compromise.
