Question:
Will any UC transmitter work with any UC receiver?


Answer:

	Absolutely not. The UC wireless systems was available in several different frequency bands depending on the country in which it is sold.
	
	As an example, in the United States, the UC was available in the UB band (692 to 716 MHz) and in the UA band (782 to 806 MHz). A transmitter in the UA band will not work with a receiver in the UB band, and vice versa.
	
	This frequency band concept also applies to the Shure ULX series and the Shure UHF series of wireless microphones.
