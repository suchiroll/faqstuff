Question:
I recently purchased a DUAL 604 turntable in nice condition. Mounted on it was a SHURE M95 G-LM cartridge with a 95G stylus.


Answer:

	The G designation meant a spherical stylus tip. A spherical replacement stylus is no longer made.
	
	We suggest you replace the M95G stylus with the N95ED elliptical stylus. This will upgrade the performance and return the cartridge to like new condition.
