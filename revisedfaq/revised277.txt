Question:
Just purchased a UT14/85-TD.  I am using this system in a House of Worship with the receiver being in a fixed position. Since there is no on/off switch, will it damage the receiver to leave it powered up all the time? 

Answer:

	It is perfectly fine to leave the receiver on all the time. It will not damage it.
