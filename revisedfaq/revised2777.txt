Question:
I am in a band and we have a didjeridoo player. We have been troubleshooting the mic situation for the didj for live performances, but now I feel we need to find a better mic. The mic we have works, but it is a little too heavy. Do you have any kind of lightweight mic that can be placed on the end of the didj that can fully capture the tones?


Answer:

	The didjeridoo is a low frequency instrument. Therefore, it requires a mic that can reproduce these low frequencies. None of these mics recommended below mount on the instrument; there would be too much handling noise. We do not recommend mounting a mic on the didjeridoo.
