Question:
I have a question about your V15vXMR needles. Can they be used for a combination of club/scratch play, or are they to delicate for scratching.


Answer:

	Absolutely not. The V15xMR stylus berylium shank is far too fragile and will likely fail after only a few backcues or scratches. Stick with the Shure products made for the DJ market.
