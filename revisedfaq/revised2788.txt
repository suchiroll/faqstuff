Title: PG81 and Phantom power option

Question:
I purchased a pair of PG81's to use in my new Marantz CDR300 portable CD Recorder. This device has phantom power but I can't tell from the PG81 literature if I should just use the included battery with no phantom power, use phantom power from the Marantz leaving the battery in, or use phantom power and remove the battery. I have only tried with no phantom and using just the battery and everything works fine. I would prefer to just remove the battery and not have to worry about replacement or leakage. However, I want to make sure that the circuitry will not be damaged by the Marantz if I do this. Also, I'm a bit confused how the Marantz supply, which I think is +48 VDC, can substitute for a AA battery.
