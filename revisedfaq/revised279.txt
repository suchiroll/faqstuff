Question:
Can I use the "plug-in-power" capabilities of my DV camcorder (SONY DV-PC100) to power the Shure SM93 lapel microphone?


Answer:

	No. What Sony calls plug-in-power is actually Bias Voltage. The SM93 requires Phantom Power. You will need a phantom power supply. We recommend the Phantom Power adapter for camcorders made by Beachtek or JuicedLink.
