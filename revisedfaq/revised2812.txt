Question:
Do you have any type of windscreen system for boundary microphones such as the Shure MX300? The application is for a boundary microphone used outdoors near a golf tee.


Answer:

	Unfortunately, we do not have a windscreen suitable for boundary mics in our current product range. However, Rycote offers a product that may work. It is a zeppelin windscreen endcap with an internal diameter of approx 5; an associated detachable ring could be used to fix the windscreen to a surface.
