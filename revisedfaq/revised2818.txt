Question:
I'm just starting to sing bass for a group i was wondering if they made a special mic for bass singers.


Answer:

	Bass singers often choose one of the these mics:
	
	Handheld use - KSM9 or Beta 87A or Beta 87C
	Mic stand only use - SM81 with A81G pop filter
	
	* All the mics above are condenser mics that require phantom power from the mixing console.
