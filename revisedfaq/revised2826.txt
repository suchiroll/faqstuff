Question:
I will be videotaping a function that will already be mic'd by a house sound system. (over which I have no control) I would like to tap into the house system's board and use a VP body pack transmitter to send the signal to my field mixer/camera location. Answer #276 describes how to do this for a musical instrument. Can it be done with a line level or mic level out from a mixer?


Answer:

	Assuming the mixer has an XLR, line level output:
	
	1) Pad the signal down to Mic level by using the Shure A15LA.
	
	2) Connect the A15LA output to the body pack transmitter using the Shure WA310 cable.
