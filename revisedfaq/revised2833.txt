Question:
Why it is called true condenser element? What is the difference between the three..electret, back-electret and true condenser?


Answer:

	True condenser: the polarizing voltage is derived from an external voltage source.
	
	Electret design: the polarizing voltage is permanently applied to either the back plate or the front diaphragm
	
	Back electret design: the polarizing voltage is permanently applied to the back plate
