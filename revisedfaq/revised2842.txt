Question:
I'm seeking an attractive recessed female XLR connector for a conference table. The Shure MX412C mic will be plugged into this connector and removed after meetings. Any suggestions?


Answer:

	FSR offers the T3-MJ recessed XLR connector. It features a cap that hides the XLR connector when not in use. Available in black or brass, it is an attractive mounting scheme. www.fsrinc.com
