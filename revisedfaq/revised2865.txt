Question:
I bought the T-series headset a few years ago, and am now thinking of upgrading the transmitter and receiver systems. The problem is that none of the UHF wireless systems in your catalogue allow a 1/4 inch input into the transmitter. If this is the case, is there anyway that I can manually rewire my WH20QTR into a WH20QTG? If so, what is the wiring configuration?


Answer:

	WH20 QTR tip connection - move to WH20TQG pin 3 connection
	
	WH20 QTR sleeve connection - move to WH20TQG pin 1 connection
	
	Do not use WH20TQG pin 2 or pin 4.
