Question:
I want to get a Shure microphone to use as a single mic for a bluegrass band - five instrumentalists playing into the same mic, all acoustic. What Shure microphone would recomend for this purpose?


Answer:

	Best: KSM44
	Better: KSM32
	Good: Beta 27
	
	For operation, all require 48 V dc phantom power to be provided by the mixing board. Also, to use this miking technique requires the use of in-ear monitors, or NO (or very little) loudspeaker monitors.
