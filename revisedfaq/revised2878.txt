Question:
Will the N78S stylus fit in and work with a V15 type II body?


Answer:

	It will with slight modification. The top of the N78S green plastic stylus grip must be filed/sanded down slightly (about 1 mm) so that the grip does not hit the V15 Type II body when the stylus is inserted. A nail file can used, but be very careful not to damage the N78S stylus when filing the plastic grip.
