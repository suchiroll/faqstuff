Question:
Can I daisy chain multiple power supplies together?


Answer:

	No. The system was designed for small to medium rental/install jobs.
	
	The issue is that while powering up the system one power supply (for a split second) will see the entire load of all the units. This load will likely cause the system to blow a fuse. Then the other supply will have the entire load, which will blow the other fuse.
