Question:
Is there a compatibility issue between the Shure M44-7 cartridge and Numark turntables?


Answer:

	The M44-7 cartridge may distort when used on a Numark Line level DJ turntable.
	
	This is possible given the extremely high output voltage of the M44-7 (9.5mV), compared to the industry average 5mV- 7mV. This is
	high output level can overload the built-in Numark preamp. It can also happen with inexpensive DJ mixers.
