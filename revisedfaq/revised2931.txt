Question:
How may I use the Countryman WCE6B or WCE6T as a wired microphone? Do I need a preamp?


Answer:

	The Countryman WCE6B and WCE6T will operate as a wired microphone, provided that the mic is connected to a Shure MX1BP preamp or the Shure RK183PK preamp.
	
	Though the MX1BP has a slightly lower output level than the RK183PK, the MX1BP can operate from phantom power or from an internal 9 volt battery, and has a mute switch.
