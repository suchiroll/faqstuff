Question:
I recently bought your Quiet Spot hands free earphone/microphone for my new iMate pocket pc.  It's great and I really like it.

I liked it so much that I also bought your E3C headphones so I could enjoy much better sounding MP3's on my new iMate.  But there is a major problem.  The E3C connector is too big to fit the iMate.  It needs to be the same size connector as the Shure Quiet Spot.  

Can you help me find an adapter to take the E3C connector down to the size of the Shure Quiet Spot?

Do you make the adapter or can you help me find one?

Answer:

	It appears that Radio Shack makes an adapter.
	
	If your iMate is mono, then get Radio Shack # 274-381.
	
	If your iMate is stereo, then get Radio Shack # 274-373.
