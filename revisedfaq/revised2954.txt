Question:
I want to rack 2 SLX receivers and bring the antennas to the front of the rack. What do I need to be able to do that?


Answer:

	Rack the two SLX receivers side by side and passively combine the antennas, using the UA221. When racking two receivers side-by-side, there is enough room to bring the antennas to the front in that same rack space. Use the antenna cables supplied with the SLX receiver.
