Question:
I have 3 Beta 87? U2 transmitters. We are highly pleased with these units and want to purchase two more, however I am having a hard time figuring out if these units are 87As (supercardioid) or 87Cs (cardioids). How do I determine what they are?


Answer:

	Older units are labelled only as "Beta 87" are A versions.  Newer units are labelled as "Beta 87A" or "Beta 87C".
