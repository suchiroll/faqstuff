Question:
How do I implement the internal low cut filter on the MX1BP?


Answer:

	The MX1BP low frequency response is a 6 dB per octave roll-off below 25 Hz. This response can be changed if desired. A low cut filter that provides a 12dB per octave roll-off below 95 Hz is available inside of the MX1BP.
	
	To implement this low cut filter:
	1. Remove the three screws from the underside of the MX1BP.
	2. Remove the plastic cover and lift the printed circuit board up and out of the pack with the attached faceplate.
	3. Change the jumper on the opposite side of the printed circuit board from its factory position over the first two pins nearest the input jack, to a position over the second and third pins.
	4. Re-assemble the MX1BP by re-seating the printed circuit board and faceplate. Replace screws.
