Question:
I am a mobile disc jockey and I do several outdoor wedding receptions during the summer and was wanting to know what mic to use so that I can mic the bride and groom and the minister. This mic can be wired or wireless but fairly inconspicuous and be able to pick-up all 3 voices so that they can all be heard over the PA system.


Answer:

	Use a wireless system, like the Shure SLX, with a bodypack transmitter, and an omnidirectional lapel mic, like the model MX183 or WL93.
	
	Place the mic on the ministers chest, about 9 inches below the chin, as he does most of the talking. The bride and groom responses will be lower in level than the minister, but they will be heard.
	
	Place the loudspeakers as far away as possible from the ministers mic to control feedback.
