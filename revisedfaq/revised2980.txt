Id: 2980
Legacy Id: 3108

Question:
Some years ago, and even today, after recently purchasing V15VxMR cartridge, I noticed on the packaging a photo showing the SHURE setup record - I suppose used for setting anti-skate, left/right channels/ phasing etc. I would Love to get hold of one of these records -if it is possible. Could you possibly let me know if one is available anywhere?


Answer:

	Shure has not sold test records since the early 1990s. Shure test records often appear for sale on Ebay. Here is a source for a different test record: http://www.britishaudio.co.uk/hfntlp.htm
