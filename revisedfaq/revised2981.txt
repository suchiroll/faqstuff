Question:
I have two SLX transmitters and they seem to have different levels of audio output. Any suggestions?


Answer:

	The SLX 1 body pack transmitter has a gain level switch on the side. Check it for the setting.
	For a lapel mic, set the switch to the "MIC" position.
	For a headworn mic, try the "0" position.
	For an instrument, use the "-10" setting.
	
	
	The SLX 2 handheld transmitter has a gain switch underneath the removable microphone head.
	For normal use, set the switch to the "0" position.
	For a really loud singer, set the switch to the "-10" position.
