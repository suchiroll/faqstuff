Question:
I just bought a microphone from eBay that looks like the MX391, except it has a 3 pin mini connector on it. It is model 700623-0002. How do I adapt this to an XLR connector?


Answer:

	That was an OEM microphone that we made for Intel. The connector on it was specialized to Intel. Follow these instructions to connect this microphone to a normal XLR input on a mixer:
	
	1) Cut off the 3-pin mini connector.
	
	2) Solder on a new 4 pin TA4F connector. This can be ordered as Shure part number WA330. Wiring is as follows:
	
	Shield - Pin 1
	Red wire - Pin 2
	Black wire - Pins 3 and 4
	
	4) Purchase the RK100PK inline electronics module. The 4 pin TA4F connector will plug into the RK100PK. The output of the RK100PK is a 3 pin XLR. The RK100PK requires phantom power from the mixer.
