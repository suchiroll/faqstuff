Question:
When setting up a complex wireless audio system in a major city, I often need to attenuate the RF signal being supplied by the antennas. Where can I obtain an adjustable RF attenuator to use with Shure UHF wireless systems?


Answer:

	Consider the model RFA-4056-03. Sold by RF Industries of San Diego, California, USA. http://www.rfindustries.com
This attenuator is adjustable in 1 dB steps up to a maximum of 30 dB. The connectors are BNC.
