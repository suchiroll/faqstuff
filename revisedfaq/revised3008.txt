Question:
Could you please advise a replacement mobile microphone suitable for the Maxon radios?


Answer:

	Due to a rapidly declining market, Shure is exiting the two-way radio/mobile communications business as of December 2004.

	Telex Communications (www.telex.com) may be able to provide you with an acceptable solution.
