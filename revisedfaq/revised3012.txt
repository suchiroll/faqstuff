Question:
The Countryman E6 distorts the SLX1 transmitter when the SLX1 is in the "mic" setting. What should I do?


Answer:

	Reset the SLX-1 to the 0 setting.
	
	In some cases, this may make the output level on the SLX4 XLR connector unacceptably low. In that case, use the 1/4 phone jack output on the SLX4; this signal is 10 dB greater than the XLR signal and has an actual impedance of 1,000 ohms.
	
	Note: When connecting the SLX 1/4 phone jack output to an XLR input, use a twisted pair, shielded mic cable configured as follows:
	phone plug sleeve - cable shield - XLR pin 1
	phone plug tip - cable inner conductor A - XLR pin 2
	phone plug sleeve - cable inner conductor B - XLR pin 3
