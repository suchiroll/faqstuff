Question:
My PGX transmitter appears to be locked. What should I do?


Answer:

	A PGX transmitter has only one button; it does everything - power, mute, and lock.
	
	Press the switch for a 2 or 3 seconds and the transmitter turns on or off.
	
	A quick press mutes/unmutes.
	
	A press for about 5 seconds makes the LED flash and toggles the transmitter between lock and unlock.
