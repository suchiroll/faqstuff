Please provide information about the wired microphone models C606W, 8900W, and 100WD. I see these mics at Apple Stores.


Answer:

	Apple Stores carry only one Shure microphone model: the 100WD. The package includes a small folding tripod desk stand. The Apple Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) for the 100WD is TA978LL/A.
