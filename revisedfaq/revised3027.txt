Question:
When using the SLX scanning feature in a sound system that includes non-SLX transmitters, should these transmitters be powered ON or OFF?


Answer:

	For multiple system setup, the SLX User Guide says to turn all receivers on and all transmitters off. This assumes that all systems in use are SLX.
	
	If non-SLX transmitters are in use, they need to be powered ON in order for the SLX scanning feature to see the frequencies in use.
