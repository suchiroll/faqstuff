Question:
My harp mic-the lovely 540D, is a controlled-magnetic mic. How is it different than a dynamic mic?


Answer:

	A controlled magnetic element is a variation of a dynamic element.
	
	In the controlled magnetic (also called controlled reluctance) element:
	1) the magnet is stationary,
	2) the wire coil is stationary,
	3) the metal diaphragm moves a ferrous rod that disturbs the magnetic field,
	4) thus causing an output signal in the wire coil.
	
	The controlled magnetic element was developed during World War II. It was a very rugged design that could stand up to military use. Shure discontinued the last controlled magnetic microphone in the early 1980s.
