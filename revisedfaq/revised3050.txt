Question:
I'm going abroad tomorrow and I'd like to know if there are any recommendations when traveling by plane with some dynamic mics? Should I bring my mics in my cabin luggage or can I put them in my checked bags without risk (I'm thinking about pressure in particular...)?


Answer:

	Shure dynamic mics have barometric leaks in the design to accommodate any type of pressure change. No need to keep them in a pressurized cabin. We cannot speak for other brands of microphones.
