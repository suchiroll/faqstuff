Question:
What is an impedance balanced output? How might it affect my use of the BLX, SLX, PGX, or PG receiver?


Answer:

	The XLR output and the 1/4 phone jack output of the BLX, SLX, PGX, and PGreceiver are impedance balanced.

	NOTE: The 1/4 phone jack output has a signal level that is 14 dB greater than the XLR output.

	On the XLR output, the impedance from pin 2 to ground is the same as from pin 3 to ground, thus the circuit is impedance balanced.
	
	Pin 1 is the cable shield and ground.
	Pin 2 supplies the audio signal.
	Pin 3 has no audio signal.
	
	When connecting the XLR output of the receiver to a balanced mic input, simply use a standard mic cable.
	
	When connecting the XLR output of the receiver to an unbalanced mic input, make certain that XLR pin 2 is connected to the tip of phone plug as XLR pin 2 supplies the audio signal.

	NOTE: A transformer balanced XLR output or active balanced XLR output has audio on pin 2 and pin 3, unlike the impedance balanced output where the audio signal is supplied only to pin 2.

	On the 1/4 phone jack output, the impedance fromtip to sleeve is the same as fromring to sleeve, thus the circuit is impedance balanced.
	
	Sleeve is the cable shield and ground.
	Tip supplies the audio signal.
	Ring has no audio signal.
	
	When connecting the 1/4 phone jack output of the receiver to a balanced XLR female mic input, use a cable with a 1/4 TRS male plug on one end and a male XLR connector on the other.

	When connecting the 1/4 phone jack output of the receiver to an unbalanced 1/4 phone jack input, use a standard instrument cable that will have the audio send on the tip and the audio return on the sleeve.
