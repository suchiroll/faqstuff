Question:
Will the N97xE stylus fit into a V15Vx body? If yes, what will be the sonic results?


Answer:

	The N97xE will fit into a V15Vx body.
	
	Using the N97xE in a V15Vx body will increase the output slightly, but slightly decrease the high end response. This stylus/body hybrid will not equal the specifications of a V15Vx. However, there will be no damage to the stylus nor the body if you create this hybrid product. If you like the sonic results, then the hybridization experiment is a success for your listening requirements.

	

	NOTE: The N97xE stylus will NOT fit in the V15V-MR body.
