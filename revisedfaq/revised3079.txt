Question:
I have lost my UT transmitter on 581.725 MHz. Can I substitute a ULX transmitter?


Answer:

	Yes, but with limitations. The ULX transmitter does not use the same audio companding circuit as the UT receiver . Therefore, a ULX/UT combination will produce an audio signal that is noiser than an all UT system or an all ULX system.
	
	Here are the six UT4 frequencies that will match to a ULX-J1 transmitter:
	
	UT Frequency 581.200 MHz (FH) and ULX Master Frequency F087
	
	UT Frequency 581.725 MHz (FJ) and ULX Master Frequency F108
	
	UT Frequency 583.000 MHz (FK) and ULX Master Frequency F159
	
	UT Frequency 585.700 MHz (FL) and ULX Master Frequency F267
	
	UT Frequency 588.050 MHz (FM) and ULX Master Frequency F361
	
	UT Frequency 589.025 MHz (FN) and ULX Master Frequency F400
