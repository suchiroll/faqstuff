Title: SLX transmitter - voltage and current requirements
Id: 3103
Legacy Id: 3236

Question:
What are the voltage and current requirements for the SLX transmitter?


Answer:

	The SLX transmitter operates on two 1.5 Vdc cells in series; this configuration provides 3 Vdc. While powered up, the transmitter will shut down when the voltage reached 2.0 Vdc. To power up, the minimum voltage must be 2.3 Vdc.
	
	Specified current consumption for an SLX transmitter is 130mA (milliamps), +/- 15 mA. Divide 130 into the milliamp rating of the AA batteries used will provide a rough estimate of the maximum battery life.
