Question:
Just thought I would drop you a story of real-life microphone applications. On Sept 11, 2005 Brantley Sound in Nashville, TN took part in a benefit for the survivors of Hurricane Katrina. We provided production for two stages, one acoustic, one electric, in a festival setting. As with most festivals, we had no idea what acts were performing, let alone stage plots. Our third act of the day, some great energetic players from New Orleans, show up and they have a Sousaphone.

Everyone was pressed for time and the Sousaphone player needed to be fully mobile, so the first instinct that I had, knowing that I was going to steal a line that already had phantom power, I taped a Beta 98 to the inside of his bell and ran with it. Lo and behold that Sousaphone rocked and filled up the bottom end like an amplified bass. Now you can add Sousaphone to your list of Beta 98 applications. Kudos Shure!!!! Youâ€™ve created yet another completely versatile microphone.
