Question:
The ball grill of my Shure mic is dented. Is there a way to repair it?


Answer:

	Bent ball-grills can be often be repaired as follows:
	
	1) Remove the ball-grill from the microphone.
	
	2) Place the ball-grill over a rounded wooden file handle; secure the file handle in a vice. File handles are sold at hardware stores.
	
	3) Using the file handle as a form inside of the ball-grill, gently reshape the ball-grill by tapping on it using a plastic or rubber hammer.
