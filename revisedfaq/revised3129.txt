Question:
I have 4 UR4D receivers and have them networked together using an ethernet router. When I connect to them with Wireless Workbench, I only see 3 of the dual receivers.


Answer:

	One possible problem is the MAC address of the receivers. Check the MAC address by following these instructions:

	
		Switch the unit on.
	
		Press the Util button
	
		Press the Network button
	
		Read the MAC address at the bottom line of the display


	With a dual receiver the left and right receiver sections will have the same MAC address as they use the same network card. However, each UR4D or UR4S should have a unique MAC address. If two of the UR4D or UR4S receivers have the same MAC address call Shure Applications Engineering at 847-600-8440.
