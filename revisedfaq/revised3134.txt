Question:
Can I dial into a corporate network over the internet to monitor and control networked UHF-R receivers when I am off-site?


Answer:

	The answer is no, if you intend to dial-in over the internet. There are issues involving subnet addresses and hand-shaking protocol that will likely prevent Wireless Work Bench 4 from operating over the internet.
	
	The answer would be maybe, if you use software such as Live Meeting or Remote Desktop which runs on top of a networks Virtual Provider Network. You would run this software on an on-site PC that is also running Wireless Work Bench 4. Then, you might be able to see Wireless Work Bench 4 when off-site. We strongly recommend that you work with your Information Services department to explore this concept.
