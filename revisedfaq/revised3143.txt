Question:
I am wondering if I can use non-Intelimix delegate consoles with the Intellimix version of the power supply and vice versa?


Answer:

	Yes, you can use non-Intellimix consoles with the Intelimix power supply. You can also use the intellimix consoles with the non-Intellimix power supply. The ConferenceOne system will only work in manual mode when mixing these components. It will not work in Intellimix mode.
