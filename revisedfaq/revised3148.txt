Question:
I'm working on a show with four channels of UHF-R. The two receivers are connected together via the Ethernet cable, I have downloaded Wireless Workbench 4 and want to connect via USB to my laptop. When I do, my laptop says it's found new hardware, and wants to know where to locate the driver for it. I don't see anything available for download.


Answer:

	The driver was downloaded with the WWB software. It will be in a sub folder of the WWB4 software.
