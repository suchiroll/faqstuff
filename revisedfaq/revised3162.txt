Question:
What is the difference between the E2c/E2g and the E3c/E3g earphones?


Answer:

	The E3c model offers several benefits compared to the less expensive E2c model. Specifically: 1. The E3c is about half the size of the E2c. This is primarily because the E3c uses a different type of speaker, called a balanced armature, which is much smaller than the dynamic speaker used in the E2c. 2. The E3c has a smaller nozzle and uses smaller sleeves than the E2c. This allows a more comfortable fit for people with small ear canals. The smaller nozzle also lets the E3cs foam sleeves to compress more fully, providing even better sound isolation than with the E2c. 3. The E3c produces a brighter, crisper sound than the E2c. This is due to the better response of the balanced armature speaker to high-frequency content such as cymbals and stringed instruments.
