Question:
What are the differences between the E4c/E4g earphones and the E5c earphones?



Answer:

	The E5c uses dual speakers in each ear (a separate woofer and tweeter), fed by an inline crossover located in the cable. This combination delivers even deeper, tighter bass, combined with beautifully neutral mids and highs. The E5c also produces an amazingly spacious soundstage. The sensation is more like listening to a set of high-end loudspeakers than traditional headphones.
