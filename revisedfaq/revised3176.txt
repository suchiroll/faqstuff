Question:
What is the difference between the E4G and the E4C-N? They are both black and seem to have the same cord length and other specs. Is the sound profile different? Does the E4G have more bass?



Answer:

	They are exactly the same earphone just in a different package. The E4G has a gaming insert and the E4C-N has our red consumer insert. Very recently we just started shipping the E4G with a rubber ear hugger. This is a soft rubber loop that holds the earphone tighter in the ear preventing it from falling out for the intense gamer. It is only shipping with the E4G and may not be on the shelves yet. It is not available as a separate item. The earphone in the package is the same product...It does NOT have more bass. Bass frequencies have a direct relation to the fit and sleeve. For the best seal use the yellow foam sleeve...hence the best bass response.
