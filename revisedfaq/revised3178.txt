Question:
I want to stiffen the "floppy" antenna wire on the SLX1 transmitter. The reason is to prevent the antenna wire from being scrunched when a user puts the SLX1 into a pocket. Any ideas?


Answer:

	Piece B: 25 mm (1") long, I.D. 5 mm (1/8")
	Piece C: 25 mm (1") long, I.D. 7 mm (3/16")
	Heat gun or hot hair dryer1) Carefully pull off the protective tip on the antenna wire. It is held on with a tiny drop of glue. Roll the tip between your fingers to break the glue bond2) With the protective tip removed, place Piece A of the heat shrink tubing over the antenna wire.

	2b) Use the heat gun to shrink the tubing.3) Place Piece B over the antenna wire.
	3a) Push it onto the wire until it hits the rubber boot at the base of the antenna.
	3b) Use the heat gun to shrink the tubing.3) Place Piece C over the antenna wire.
	3a) Push it onto the wire until it covers the rubber boot at the base of the antenna.
