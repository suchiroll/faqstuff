Question:
Is the triple flange sleeve compatible with the E2c headphones?


Answer:

	No they are not. The Nozzle is too big for the triple flange sleeve. A triple flange sleeve will not fit over the nozzle and still be comfortable for the user. PA755 will NOT fit the E2, E2C, E2g, I2C, or SCL2.
