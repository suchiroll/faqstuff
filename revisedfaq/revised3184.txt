Question:
I was wondering if Shure earphones would get ruined due to sweating. I want to use them for mountain biking and exercise.


Answer:

	Shure earphones have been used by professional performers on stage for several years. They are typically worn for hours at a time, and as one can imagine, the earphones are exposed to a lot of sweat. All Shure earphones are testedin the presence of heat, humidity, and salt spray to make sure that they work in such a hostile environment.
	
	In extreme cases, excessive moisture in the earphone can cause a reduction in output level or a change in sound quality. After the earphone dries out (overnight for example), performance returns to normal.It isdoubtful one would notice any performance change during a typical one or two-hour workout.It is a good idea towipe the earphones off with a towel or tissue after using them. If you use the foam sleeves, you may want to replace them a bit more frequently than normal -- perhaps once a week. The plastic or silicone rubber sleeves do not absorb moisture, and can be used again and again.
	
	Be certain to clean the earphones of wax/debris on a regular basis according to the supplied instructions.
	
	The Shure earphone line will tolerate sweat. Shure earphones are designed for musicians on stage where sweat is always a factor. Ifone doesget a fair amount of moisture in the earphone there may be a reduction in sound level for a day. Let the earphones dry out overnight and they almost always return to normal. If not, contact Shure Repair and Service.
