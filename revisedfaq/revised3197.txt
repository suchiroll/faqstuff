Question:
What are the differences between the Gaming Edition earphones and the regular models?



Answer:

	Shure Gaming Edition (EG series) earphones deliver the same outstanding sound quality, isolation, and fit as Shures award-winning consumer models, in a format designed for use with portable gaming devices like the Sony PSP. Gaming Edition earphones are black, and feature a shorter cable (6 inches) and gaming-oriented packaging. Other than that it is EXACTLY the same product and will sound EXACTLY the same. Color, cable length, and packaging is the only difference between the EC series and EG series.
