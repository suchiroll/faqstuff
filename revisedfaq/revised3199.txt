Question:
Will the sleeves for Shure earphones fit other brands of earphones?


Answer:

	The fit between the earphone nozzle and the sleeve is critical to achieving good sound quality and isolation. Shure does not test its sleeves with other brands of earphones, and does not recommend their use with other brands of earphones. Nor do we recommend our earphones to be used with other manufacturers sleeves.
