Question:
What is the warranty on Shure earphones?


Answer:

	A valid purchase receipt from an authorized dealer is required for warranty service on all Shure earphones. In the U.S., warranty service will only be considered for products purchased within the last two years and covers manufacturing and material defects only. A non-warranty fee will apply to products determined to have failures relating to misuse, abuse, or earwax buildup. This fee will also apply to products less than two years old without a valid receipt or purchased from a non-authorized retailer. Please see http://www.shure.com/servicefor U.S. non-warranty pricing and directions on sending in your earphones.
