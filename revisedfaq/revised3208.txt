Question:
How can I connect more than one potentiometer at the logic input of the P4800 so each potentiomenter can control a desired gain in a desired output?


Answer:

	Yes, you can connect 8 potentiometers. There are 8 control inputs on the P4800. Connect a 100k audio taper potentiometer to each of the Control Inputs.
