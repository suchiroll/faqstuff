Question:
I own a QSHI3 quietspot headset, but I'd like to switch to stereo audio for music. To help me decide between i2c and i3c, I would like to know if the drivers on the i2c are the same as the QSHI3.

In other words, besides the i2c being stereo, can I expect the same or better quality on a i2c than on a QSHI3 when listening to music?








Answer:

	Well there is a couple issues here that you are experiencing. First off...yes the driver is technically the same....but the QSHI3 is not really meant for music playback...also music is not meant to be heard in just one ear...especially with sound isolating earphones. The music you hear is probably somewhat thin and not a lot of bass. This is due to the seal in your ear....and the fact that your are only hearing it in one ear not two. The QSHI3 has the capability of full range music but it wont accurately be perceived by you. Also the fact that youre plugging in a 3 conductor plug into a 4 conductor jack could effect the phase of your music...making it sound washy and not very present.
	
	So....with two ears sealed and a proper seal and phase, you probably will perceive a better sound with the same driver....with the I3C you really will. Also keep in mind the actual quality of the music on your phone. Most likely its at 128kbs which will sound a little washy especially in the high end detail....where the I3C will give you that advantage....or disadvantage. The I3C will probably fit a little better because of the smaller size though.
