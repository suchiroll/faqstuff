Question:
What are the specifications for the mounting screws provided with a Shure phono cartridge?


Answer:

	The mounting screw is specified as:
	
	#3-48 UNC 2A
	
	#3 = the screw diameter. Slightly less than 1/10 of an inch (2.5 mm).
	48 = 48 threads per inch
	UNC = Unified National Coarse (type of thread)
	2 = thread precision (average)
	A = external thread (B = internal thread like on a nut)
	
	The length of the mounting screw varies based on the thickness of phono cartridge body. Typical lengths are 1/2 inch (13mm) to 7/8 inch (22 mm). The cartridge body has a slot through which the fastening screw passes: the diameter of this slot is typically 1/8.
