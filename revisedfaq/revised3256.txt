Question:
What is the color code standard for phono cartridge wiring?

Answer:

	The color code below applies to the majority of turntables and tone arms:
	Left = white wire
	Left Ground = blue wire
	Right = red wire
	Right Ground = green wire
	
	Be certain to check your turntable user guide to confirm the colors above.
	
	
	For a removable headshell, the "typical" wiring is as follows - viewed from the wire side of the headshell connector:
	Upper left = white
	Upper right = red
	Lower left = blue
	Lower right = green
	
	Again, this may vary depending on the model and make of the turntable.
