Question:
How far does a microphone diaphragm move with a really loud sound source?


Answer:

	The answer is much less than you may think.
	
	Some microphone users worry about the diaphragm wearing out because of use. In reality, a mic diaphragm moves so little that wearing out is not a cause for concern. Lets see how far a microphone diaphragm actually moves when exposed to a loud sound.
	
	120 db SPL is the threshold of pain for the human ear. For the sound source, we will use 140 dB SPL. 140 dB SPL is a weather warning siren at 50 feet; a level that would quickly damage ones hearing.
	
	Using this dangerously loud acoustic signal, the diaphragm of a typical professional quality microphone will move a total of 8 microns. A human hair is about 80 microns thick, so the diaphragm moves about 1/10 the diameter of a human hair.
	
	8 microns = .000008 meter
	8 microns = .0008 millimeter
	8 microns = .00003 inch
	8 microns = 1/30,000 of an inch
