Question:
I see that in for the PSM700 H3 band, that Group 2, Channel 2 and Channel E are only 0.05 MHz apart from each other. Are these channels compatible and are they supposed to be compatible?


Answer:

	For the H3 band, group 2 is NOT designed nor intended to be a compatible set of 16. This was intentional.
	
	Group 1 is a compatible set of 16.
	
	In Group 2, the first 10 frequencies (channels 0-9) are compatible. The remaining 6 frequencies were designed to maximize the number of frequencies when various TV stations are active.
	
	Thus, do not consider Group 2 to be a compatible set of 16, but instead use Wireless Workbench to find the maximum number of compatible channels in your particular city.
	
	All of these statements are also true for the L2 band.
