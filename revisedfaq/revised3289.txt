Question:
What is the wiring scheme to connect a Shure condenser microphone, such as the WH30, WL183, WL184, WL185, etc., to an Electro-Voice RE-2 system, model BPU-2 wireless bodypack transmitter?

Answer:

	The bodypack transmitter for the Electro-Voice RE-2 wireless microphone system is designated as model BPU-2. The microphone connector on the EV transmitter accepts Switchcraft TA4F connectors.
	
	Following is the wiring for the connector when a Shure condenser microphone, such as the WH30 or WL183, is used:
	

	
		
			
				EV Transmitter Wiring
			
				Shure Microphone Wiring
		
		
			
				Pin 1: shield
			
				Shield
		
		
			
				Pin 2: audio
			
				Black
		
		
			
				Pin 3: +5V bias
			
				Red
		
		
			
				Pin 4: +5V bias thru 3.3k ohm resistor
			
				Do not use
		
	



	Note that the Electro-Voice wiring scheme is different from the Shure bodypack transmitters, which use the same connector.
