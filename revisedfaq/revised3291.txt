Question:
I am interested in miking a Leslie cabinet.  Which microphone would you suggest for the horns and which for the bottom?




Answer:

	To see which microphone we recommend on a Leslie, please see our Selection Guide.

	

	Use the same model for both in order to maintain a consistent timbre.
