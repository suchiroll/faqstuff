Question:
I have to reorder sleeves....how do I know what size I have?

Answer:

	On the soft flex sleeves (Gray rubber or Black(E2c version)...If you flip the earphone sleeve inside out there should be a S,M, or L on the inside. If its clear you may be able to see through it. If you are using the sleeve that came on the earphone it is a medium. There is only one size yellow foam (For E3,E4,E5,E500 variation) and 3 sizes for the E2 variation. You will have to line up the orange foam to determine what size you have.
	
	Black foam sleeves are now made with dots on the bottom of the sleeve. 1 dot = small, 2 dots= medium, 3 dots= large
	
	You can then order that same sleeve in multiple pairs from our website and have enough for years to come.
