Question:
How are miniature mics hidden on actors when used in the theatre?


Answer:

	
		To better blend the color of the microphone cable to wardrobe, one can use a spray-on dye, such as Magix Spray, typically sold in shoe repair shops. It is available in different colors and can be sprayed or brushed onto a lavalier cable. Avoid getting the spray on the mic capsule. Magix Spray can be removed with surgical spirits. As a more permanent alternative to Magix Spray, use a permanent Sharpie (www.sharpie.com) or Copic Marker (www.copicmarker.com) to color mic cables. Again, avoid the mic capsule.
	
		To mount a miniature mic in the hairline, twist the mic and its cable around an elastic band/loop of an appropriate color, then attached the elastic band/loop in the hair. Hide the band/loop and cable under the hair.
	
		Toupee clips can be used to hide miniature mics in hair or in wigs. These should be affixed as close to the scalp as is comfortable so they wont flap around with loose or long hair.
	
		For placing lavalier mics under clothing, Rycote (www.rycote.com) makes adhesive-based Stickies products.
