Question:
After cleaning one of the sides and placing the ear piece back on the monitor  when I turned it upside down what appears to be a small white fabric of some sort has fallen out.

I am not sure as to what this actually was however when I looked into both ear tubes I noticed that they now appeared different to each other. I then went to listen to the earphone for a brief moment to  observe the sound coming out of each earpiece it appears there is a slight difference in sound now. What happened.


Answer:

	You removed the small damper/filter that is inside the nozzle of all of our earphones. The damper should not be removed. When removing debris from a clogged nozzle please do not puncture through the filter. If it is removed and you notice a difference in sound you will need to send it in to us for replacement.
