Question:
There was a Black foam sleeve attached to my SE model earphones. Can I order more?


Answer:

	The black foam sleeve is a new alternative that was introduced on a wider basis in early 2007. All SE model earphones (SE110, SE210, SE310, SE420, SE530(PTH) ship with a newer fit kit containing 3 different sizes. Also the SCL3,SCL4 and SCL5 earphones ship with black and yellow foam in the included fit kit.The black foam sleevesis available as an accessory in packages of 10, and are compatible with all Shure E3/E3c/E3g/I3c, E4/E4c/E4g/I4c, E5/E5c,SCL3,SCL4,SCL5 and E500PTH earphones.

	

	Please note the Black foam does not fit the SCL2 or E2 series earphones. Part Numbers for Black Foam Sleeves are:
	
	EABKF1-10S : 5 pair of small
	EABKF1-10M : 5 pair of medium
	EABKF1-10L : 5 pair of large
	
	At this time we do not have a variety pack of sleeves available.
