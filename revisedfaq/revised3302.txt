Question:
Can I carry the E500 and PTH device in the supplied carrying case?

Answer:

	After market research we performed we found that the majority of people preferred a more portable solution with something that could fit in a pocket rather than a larger, bulkier case. This resulted in our current oval shaped case that is supplied with the E500PTH.
	
	PLEASE NOTE:
	Both the E500 and Push to hear device will not properly fit in the supplied case and if attempted could damage the earphones. Please only carry the E500 with extension cables or the PTH in the case. It is easiest to wrap the earphones around a couple fingers and lay them in the case and then zip the case closed.
