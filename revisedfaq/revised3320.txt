Question:
I have a Shure V15 Type IV cartridge and would like to get a replacement stylus or another cartridge.  All I can find are "slightly used" units or replacement stylus from Japan.  Supposed to be high quality but I don't know.  I'd appreciate any advice.

Answer:

	Sorry, Shure no longer has stock of the V15 IV stylus.
	
	Please see the following link for many sources where you can purchase discontinued Shure styli. You may find a V15 IV stylus at one of these suppliers:Sources for Discontinued Styli and Phono Cartridges
	
	Used styli are not recommended as you have no idea how much wear has accumulated on the diamond tip.
	
	A replacement stylus, not made by Shure, could be OK, but there is no way to know this before you make the purchase.
	
	If you still have a V15 IV stylus, you can have it re-tipped by: www.vandenhul.com
	
	Or replace the entire cartridge with a new Shure M97xE.
