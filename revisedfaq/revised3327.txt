Question:
Are there two outputs on the PG88 two channel receiver?

Answer:

	The PG88 has two receiver sections. Each section has a balanced, XLR male, mic level output, and an unbalanced, 1/4" female phone jack output.
	
	So the rear of the PG88 has four output connectors: two XLR male plugs , and two 1/4" female phone jacks.
