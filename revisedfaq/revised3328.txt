Question:
What are the differences between the E3, E3c, E3c-n, and E3g


Answer:

	There is no difference other than color and packaging between any of our E3 models. The black versions (E3g and E3c-n) do have a 6 inch shorter cable than the E3 and E3c. All will sound exactly the same and ship with the same accessories.
