Question:
I'm looking for some Shure wireless components that were discontinued years ago.   I know Shure does have an remaining inventory. Where else can I look?

Answer:

	1) Call the Shure rep for your region.
	The rep may know of Shure dealers that still have older Shure model in stock.
	
	2) There is a company that specializes in older audio equipment:
