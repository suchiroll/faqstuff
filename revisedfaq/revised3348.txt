Question:
Our vocalist prefers the SM57, I am wondering if there is a way to set up the '57 on one of your wireless systems? Is there a wireless SM57 cartridge available?


Answer:

	Sorry, there is no SM57 wireless mic cartridge.
	
	Here is an idea: use the SM58 wireless mic cartridge and replace the SM58 ball grill with the Beta 57 grill (RK278G).
