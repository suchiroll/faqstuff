Question:
Is it possible to put a Beta 87A grille on a Beta 58A mic?  I want to get the benefits of the 87A 3-stage pop filter, plus I believe the 87A grille is slightly longer, which will benefit me since I tend to eat the mic a bit when I sing.

Answer:

	Sorry, this does not work. The Beta 87 grill has a smaller inner diameter and it will not fit over the Beta 58 mic cartridge.
