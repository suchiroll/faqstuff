Question:
I just purchased an SFG-2. I noticed that the underside of the lever arm has a 4 cm indented section in which there is adhesive. Was there supposed to be something attached here? And will the measurements be off as a result?


Answer:

	This area is the underside of the aluminum piece showing the grams: 1.5 ---1.25 --- 1.00 ---.75 --- .50. The adhesive is on the underside of this piece.
	
	The adhesive holds this piece to the upper side of the balance arm. You are looking at the adhesive that is really not required because the balance arm has a 4 cm rectangular opening.
