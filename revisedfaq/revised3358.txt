Question:
Are the SE earphones compatible with iPhone? Will the plug fit?

Also, regarding you upcoming iPhone adapter - will the on-wire button support a double-clicking action to advance to the next song in your play list? The included Apple headphones do this, and this a big feature, since you don't have to take the iPhone out every time you want to skip ahead.



Answer:

	Shure has released the Music Phone Adapter. It provides the ability to use Shure SE model earphones with the iPhone and to send/receive phone calls. The part number is MPA-3C. It is most commonly found at Apple stores and at www.apple.com.
	
	Yes, the Shure adapter does support the double-click feature to advance, pause and play music tracks.
	
	Currently all SE model earphones shipping now have the recessed plug that will fit the iPhone if you prefer to not use the MPA-3C.
	
	The MPA-3C was discontinued in Aug 2010.
