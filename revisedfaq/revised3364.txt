Question:
Is there a volume control or attenuator available for the earphones? When I plug the earphones into the seat on an airplane, it is always too loud.


Answer:

	Since Shure earphones are very sensitive, the headphone jacks on airplanes and other devices can be a problem. Radio Shacksells an earphone volume control to lower the level from the airplane seat and provide a more comfortable level.
	
	This can also reduce the problem of excess hiss, hum and background noise from the airplanes headphone jack.
