Question:
I'm interested in purchasing some of your products that would work as a Mobile Headset, but your web site indicates it is not compatible with my
Cingular 8525 (now called AT 8525) which is manufactured by HTC as the Dash, WING, Mogul.   Do you have anything that would work?


Answer:

	That phone uses a proprietary connector and we do not have a product that will directly connect to it.
	
	Here is a link to a website that carries an adapter for 3.5mm headphones. It however does not pass a microphone so this adapter and SE model earphones would work for stereo music playback only.

	This adapter has a built in microphone and send/end button and would work well with SE model earphones due to the modular short cable.
