Question:
When was the FP16A audio distribution amp discontinued? What can I use in its place?


Answer:

	The Shure FP16A was discontinued in autumn 2007; all remaining inventory was depleted by December 2007.
	
	The final U.S. retail price for the FP16A was $684.22. The FP16A rack mount kit, A16R, was $37.13.
	
	The FP16 was introduced in 1985 at a U.S. retail price of $350. The FP16A replaced the FP16 (features remained the same; Shure changed to a different supplier) in 1989 and had a U.S. retail price of $570.
