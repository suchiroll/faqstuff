Title: TTL logic converted to dry contact closure switch

Question:
I am replacing old Astatic push to talk microphones that have dry contact switches with MX412D/C microphones. Do you have a circuit or interface diagram to use the additional wires that seem to provide a 5 volt logic switch when push to talk is activated. I am providing phantom voltage to the mic to power the electronics.


Answer:

	These devices convert a TTL signal (from the MX412 or any device with a TTL Switch/Gate Out)into dry switch contacts:RDL ST-LCR-1 (momentary contact relay)and RDL ST-LCR-2 (alternate action relay).The manufacturer is Radio Design Labs.

	Connections:
	MX412D White wire to RDL SLAVE terminal. White is SWITCH OUT.
	MX412D Green wire to RDL GROUND terminal. Green is LOGIC GROUND.

	Note: The TTL logic outputs of multiple Shure MX mics may be wired in parallel to control a single RDL ST-LCR unit. For example, the ST-LCR may be used to mute a group of microphones using the TTL logic controls on an automatic mixer, like the Shure SCM810.

	TheSWITCH OUTwires from multiple MX412D units are wired in parallel and connected to the ST-LCR SLAVE terminal.
	The LOGIC GROUND wiresfrom multiple MX412D units are wired in parallel and connected to the ST-LCR GROUND terminal.
	When any MX412D PUSH switch is pressed, the ST-LCR relays will activate.

	Multiple MUTE INs on the SCM810 are wired to one terminal of the ST-LCR relay.
	The SCM810 LOGIC GROUND is wired to the complementary terminal of the ST-LCR relay.
	When the MUTE INs are connect to LOGIC GROUND through theST-LCR relay,the mic audio signals are muted within the SCM810.
