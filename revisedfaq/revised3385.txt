Question:
I have an old microphone made by Shure Brothers, Unidyne dynamic microphone.  It is a tabletop model, and the model # stamped on it is 
DY12P (or possibly DY12F) kind of hard to make out the last letter.  I read through the history section on the Shure Brothers website and did 
not see this model number anywhere.  Can you just point me in a direction to where I can find out more about this microphone?  It would 
be most appreciated.  Thank you!


Answer:

	The DY12 is a model 55S. Specs are exactly the same:
