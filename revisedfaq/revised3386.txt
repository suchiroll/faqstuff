Question:
I read in another FAQ that if I send you my earphone model and inform you that I am using an ipod (which I am), you'll be able to let me know which levels are safe for listening without damaging my ears.

I have the SE210's and a Third generation iPod, I would really appreciate it if you could help me determine which levels are safe!

Answer:

	In the United States, the safe listening level for 8 hours is 90 dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level).
	
	The SE210 has a rating of 114 dB SPL with an input level of 1 milliwatt. Working backward:
	
	.5 milliwatt(mW) = 111 dB
	.25 mW = 108 dB
	.12 mW = 105 dB
	.06 mW = 102 dB
	.03 mW = 99 dB
	.015 mW = 96 dB
	.007 mW = 93 dB
	.0035 mW = 90 dB
	
	Now you must ask Apple this question: What setting on my Ipod will deliver .0035 mW into a earbud with an impedance of 26 ohms? Apple's answer will provide the setting you seek.
