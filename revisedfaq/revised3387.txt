Title: Bridging a signal source
Id: 3387

Question:
When bridging why does 10 times the signal source give maximum voltage transfer?


Answer:

	10 times the source impedance is consider a nice balance between acceptable voltage transfer and acceptable input noise. Maximum voltage transfer occurs when the load impedance is infinitely higher than the source.
	
	See the formula at: Should I match impedances?
