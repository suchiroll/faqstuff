Question:
Which Shure model earphones do you recommend for light exercise at the

gym? I don't do heavy running, but lots of time on elliptical bikes and fast

treadmill walking.


Answer:

	I recommend the model SE 110.

	
	
	However, note the following caveats:

	
	
	1) Some people have tiny ear canals and will find earphones uncomfortable.

	
	
	2) Some people have excessive wax and perspiration in their ear canals and the earphones will slip out. Exercise makes this worse.

	
	
	3) Good bass response in earphones is a function on how well the ear canal is sealed.

	
	
	4) Liking the sound of an earphone is subjective and personal.

	
	
	Therefore, I strongly recommend that you check out the return policy of the Shure earphone vendor before you buy, as any of the above may cause you to not like the earphones...from any manufacturer.
