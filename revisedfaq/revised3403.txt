Question:
Is it possible to be shocked by static electricity through headphones / earphones?



Answer:

	Yes, it is possible.In a cold climate with low humidity, it is easy to build up a static charge on ones body.As an example, wearing shoes with leather soles while shuffling ones feet on a wool carpet will often build up a substantial static charge.When a part of ones body touches an item that is grounded (like the screw on a switch wall plate), the bodys static electricity will discharge to the grounded screw.The amount of electrical current in such a static discharge is not harmful, though the discharge itself can startle.
	
	The cable that carries the audio signal from the headphone jack to the headphones / earphones has metallic wire inside.This wire is also a path to ground through which the static charge can travel. Though ones ears are touching the plastic parts of the headphones / earphones, there is metallic wire inside of the headphones / earphones.A static charge often has a high enough voltage to leap from ones ear to the metal inside of the headphones /earphones, discharging the static electricity via the cable and into the device playing the audio signal, e.g., CD player or MP3 player.
	
	It is important to note that such static discharges are acts of nature and do not indicate that ones headphones / earphones are defective.Nor will the static discharge cause harm to the headphones / earphones.
