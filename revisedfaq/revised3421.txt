Question:
If I do not connect the extra two wires for the LED, does the LED still turn on?


Answer:

	Yes, the LED will be on if the logic wires are not connected to anything. On the bi-color version, the LED will be green. On the version with the red LED ring located near the mic element, the LED will be lit red.
