Question:
How are the wires connected in to and out ofthe MX202 plate-mount preamp?


Answer:

	The input is a terminal strip with 3 connection points; the output is the same type of terminal strip.
	
	The preamp input is labelled: R B S
	
	R  =  red wire (carries +5 Vdc bias to the mic)
	B  =  black wire (carries the audio signal from the mic)
	S  =  cable shield (return path for bias and audio)
	
	
	The preamp output is labelled: S  +  -
	
	+  =  audio send
	-  =  audio return
	S  =  cable shield
	
	The ppeamp output is a balanced, mic level signal.   
	
	NOTE: The MX202 preamp requires phantom power to operate.
