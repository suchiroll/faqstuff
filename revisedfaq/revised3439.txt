Title: UR1 and UR1M Input Impedance

Question:
What is the actual input impedance of the UR1 and UR1M bodypacks?


Answer:

	In the UR1, the input impedance is 1 megohm in all three input trim settings(-10 / 0 / +15 dB).  All three settings have a capacitor added to mimic the capacitance of a 10 foot (3 meters) guitar cable.
	The UR1M Micro-Bodypack Transmitter has a different input stage from the UR1. 
	
	In the UR1M, the input impedance is 200 kohms at the 0 and +15dB settings.  In the -10dB setting, the input impedance is 900 kohms.  Again, all three settings have capacitance added to mimic a 10 foot guitar cable. We recommend using the -10dB setting for guitar.
