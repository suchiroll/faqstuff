Question:
How can I tell the difference between the VN45E, VN45HE and VN45MR stylus by appearance?


Answer:

	I only have photos for reference:
	
	VN45MR- The word SHURE is black.
	
	VN45HE - The word SHURE is white (or perhaps silver)
	
	VN478E - The word SHURE is white, on a green background.
	
	VN4G - The word SHURE is red.
	
	I find no reference to a model VN45E.
