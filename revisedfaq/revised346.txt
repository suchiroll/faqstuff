Question:
Would splitting the output of a U4S wireless receiver (in Mic output mode) to two independent mixers give me any problems like a crackling, overdriven noise on one of the systems?

Answer:

	No, there shouldnt be any problem with the splitting the audio output of a wireless receiver to 2 different mixers.
