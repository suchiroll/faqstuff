Question:
I have an SLX4L. I need to make the Logic status of Logic Pin 1 High (+5V) when the mic is active, and Low (0V) when the mic is muted. This would be the reverse of how it is shipped. Is this possible?


Answer:

	Yes. This is possible, but only through a modification made to a PC board inside the SLX4L receiver. Normally a transmitter that is on will result in a 0V status on pin 1 of the logic output.
	
	
	
	Here are instructions to reverse the pin 1 status:
	
	Step 1: Remove the chassis case from the SLX4L. Remove the 4 screws from the sides of the SLX4L as shown.
	
	
	
	Step 2: Push down on the front edge of the receiver case and slide the case shell backward to reveal the PC boards inside.
	
	
	
	Step 3: Locate the PC daughterboard inside. It is the smaller of the two.
	
	Step 4: With a soldering iron, remove resistor R8 from its position.
	
	
	
	Step 5: With a soldering iron, place same resistor to position R9.
	
	
	Step 6: Reassemble the SLX4L.
	
	A transmitter that is on should now result in a +5V logic signal at pin 1 of the logic output.
