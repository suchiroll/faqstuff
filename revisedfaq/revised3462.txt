Question:
What frequencies should I use for the X1 band of the UHF-R series?


Answer:

	The X1 band operates in the 944 - 952 MHz range.This range is primarily used by STL (Studio-Transmitter Link) transmissions between a radio station studio and the radio stations transmitting antenna.
	
	Set all of the X1 band systems to the same group and different channels within that group. The channels within a single group are preprogrammed to be compatible.
	
	If you are using the X1 band along with other frequency bands, use the Shure Wireless Workbench Software to perform frequency coordination calculations.
	
	To assist in choosing frequencies that are not being used by STL transmissions, you can use the scanning function of the receiveras described in the User Guide.
