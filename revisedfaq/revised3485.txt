Title: Unbalanced stereo headphone output converted into XLR outputs

Question:
Is there a device that will conveniently convert the stereo headphone output of my laptop computer or MP3 player into balanced, low impedance signal on a male XLR connector? I want to send the signal via a snake to a mixing console, or into a Shure transmitter using the WA310 cable.
