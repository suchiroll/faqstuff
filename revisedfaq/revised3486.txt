Question:
Is there an XLR cable connector that converts from male to female? I want to fabricate a mic cable with a male/female XLR on both ends. It would be very useful!


Answer:

	In 2008, Neutrik introduced a unisex XLR connector, named the convertCON. Sliding the outer barrel forward provides a female XLR connector, and sliding the outer barrel backwards provides a male XLR connector. Very clever!
