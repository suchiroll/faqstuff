Question:
I am searching for an inline mic preamp that does not use a battery, but is powered via phantom. Does Shure make such a device?


Answer:

	Shure does not, but a company in England does. Check out the FEL MicBooster products www.micbooster.com
	
	Because of the current limitations of phantom power, the FEL units can only supply between +20 and +40 dB of gain.
