Question:
Where can I purchase a longer link cable for my SCM mixers?


Answer:

	The SCM link cable has an 8 pin, mini DIN male connector on each end. The cable is wired straight through, i.e., pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, etc. Note that the audio connections between the mixers are unbalanced and medium impedance, so the link cable must be kept are short as possible to minimize hum/buzz.
