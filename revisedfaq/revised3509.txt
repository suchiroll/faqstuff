Question:
Can the microphones in an MX396 (-BI or -TRI) be paralled together to a single microphone input on a mixer (example: SCM268)?How does this affect the LED?


Answer:

	The microphones in an MX396 will work when paralleled together.This particular wiring arrangement is not optimum, and therefore is not recommended. Here are some suggestions and notes:
	

	
		In most cases, paralleling the microphones in an MX396 essentially creates an omnidirectional microphone.Alternate products, such as the MX393/O (with mute button and LED indicator) or the MX391/O (without mute button and LED indicator) microphones will provide equivalent omnidirectional performance at a better price point.
	
		The LED indicator on the MX396 will not illuminate to full brightness when a single microphone input is providing phantom power to all elements.
	
		When paralleling multiple microphones, be sure to connect the microphones together so they are operating with the same polarity. This will prevent erratic sound pick-up due to inverted polarity cancellation. Join the Audio + wires together and connect to XLR connector pin 2. Connect the Audio - wires together and connect to XLR connector pin 3. The cable shield connects to XLR connector pin 1. The color code for the wires is:
