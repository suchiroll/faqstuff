Question:
I unearthed one my turntables (Yamaha YP-B4) and it has the Shure 1200HRP cartridge. It sounds pretty good still, but I no longer have any of the documentation.


Answer:

	The 1200HRP is equivalent to the Shure M110HE.
	
	7.3 grams in weight
	1.0 to 1.5 grams tracking force
	4.0 mV output level
	0.000025 centimeter per dyne of force static compliance
