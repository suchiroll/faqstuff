Question:
Can I voice record onto my iPod/iPhone with an MPA-3C Music Phone Adapter?


Answer:

	The current and most recent Apple iPod lineup supports voice recording in the firmware of the device. The headphone jack on the iPod is now a 4-conductor jack just like the iPhone. When using an MPA-3C it does properly work and you can record to the iPod through this feature.
	
	Please note this is only capable on the current lineup of iPods:
	
	iPod classic 120GB
	iPod Nano (4th Generation)
	iPod touch (2nd Generation)
	
	
	
	
	The iPod Shuffle does not support Voice Recording.
