Question:
I just bought a used T-Series with the SM58 handheld. Aside from needing to order a new power cord (worn at wall-wart end), I need to know if it's okay for both the receiver A AND B lights to be lit at the same time. The operating guide mentions one or the other. I've "home" tested the system and it works very well.


Answer:

	Yes, it is just fine if the A and B lights are both lit.
