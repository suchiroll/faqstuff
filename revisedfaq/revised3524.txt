Question:
I have 2 audio mixers, M367 models. When I am doing a live mix on legal depositions, I need to adjust and some of the pods or knobs and when I do, some make noise when I adjust. I have heard this is dirt build-up. How can I clean these to make like new or much better? Is there a cleaner that I can purchase?


Answer:

	Look at the De-Oxit aerosol spray cleaners from CAIG Labs.These are effective and used by Shure Service.
