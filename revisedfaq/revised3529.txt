Title: P4800 Audio Distortion When Using Delay

Question:
I have a P4800 in an installation. It works fine until I try to add signal delay; then the audio distorts. Any ideas?


Answer:

	It is likely that one of the two RAM chips that control the signal delay are defective or need to be re-soldered to the pc board. Please contact Shure Service to have the unit repaired.
