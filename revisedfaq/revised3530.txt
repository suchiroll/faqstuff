Question:
Some Shure products use a Phoenix Euro block connector for audio inputs and outputs. I'd like a supply of short jumper cables for testing purposes: one end being an XLR and the other being a female Euro block connector. Is there a source for such cables?


Answer:

	Wiring:
	XLR pin 1 to Euro Block Ground and Cable Shield
	XLR pin 2 to Euro Block Positive
	XLR pin 3 to Euro Block Negative
