Question:
Can I use Shure earphones with the third generation iPod Shuffle?



Answer:

	The 3rd-generation iPod Shuffle is controlled exclusively by buttons on the earphone cord; there is only a power switch on the player itself.This means that Shure earphones - even when equipped with the MPA Music Phone Adapter - are not directly compatible with this player.The MPAs control button does allow you to control Play/Pause, Track Forward/Previous, and the new VoiceOver track ID feature, but you cannot adjust the volume.

	

	A control accessory for the iPod Shuffle is available from: http://www.scosche.com/
