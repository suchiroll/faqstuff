Question:
I have 4 UHF-R receivers connected via ethernet to my computer. When I go to live mode one of the receivers always says it is off line. What can be the problem?


Answer:

	Typically, a receiver will show offline when Wireless Workbench had connected properly to the receiver and then a cable comes unplugged or the receiver is turned off.


	Here are other items to check:

	
		Make certain each receiver and the computer do not have duplicate IP addresses. (Shown in the Network menu).
	
		Make certain the receivers do not have a duplicate Device ID. (Shown in the Network menu).
	
		Make certain the subnet mask is exactly the same between all receivers and the computer.
	
		Make certain you are using the latest version of Wireless Workbench.
	
		Make certain the receivers have the latest firmware.
	
		If using USB to connect the computer to a receiver, there should be 4 receivers or less.
	
		Make certain Monitor Only is not selected in the File menu.
