Question:
Ware reviewing the order for your SCM810 or SCM810E automatic mixer product. But, we will using the 120VAC and 230VAC both according to the on site condition. I checked your specification sheet and user guide for the SCM810 model. I checked the comments on your data sheet that we can change the voltage from 120V to 230VAC via the internal modification. But, I can't find the methods for the voltage selection on your user guide. That is, if I order your SCM810 model, can I change the voltage from 120VAC to 230VAC at on site?


Answer:

	The SCM800/SCM810 can be internally modified to operate from either 120 Vac or 230 Vac power. Follow these steps to change the operating voltage:
	
		Disconnect the unit from the ac power source.
	
		Remove the eight Phillips head screws to remove the top cover.
	
		Locate voltage selector switch SW903 adjacent to the power transformer (T901).
	
		Use a screwdriver to turn the center rotor to the 230 V position for 230 V operation, or to the 120 V position for 120 V operation.
	
		Locate fuse F901 and remove it.
	
		Replace fuse F901 with a 100 mA, 250 V, time-delay fuse for 230 V operation, or a 200 mA, 250 V, slow-blow fuse for 120 V operation.
	
		If changing to 230 V operation, replace the power cord with a cord rated for 230 V operation (an IEC appliance connector on the equipment end and a CEE 7/7 Schuko mains connector on the other end).*
	
		If changing to 120 V operation, replace the power cord with a cord rated for 120 V operation (an IEC appliance connector on the equipment end and a mains connector suitable for 120 V operation on the other end).*

	*For systems that require other mains connectors, obtain a power cord with an IEC 320 type mating connector for connection to the unit, and an appropriate plug on the other end for connection to the mains.
