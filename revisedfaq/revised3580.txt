	1854 - Antonio Meucci - controlled reluctance (moving armature) microphone.Working Meucci examples are in the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum, Staten Island, NY.As Meucci did not patent this device, his name is almost never mentioned in the history of the microphone.
	
	1874 - E.W. Siemens - moving coil (dynamic) microphone. U.S. Patent 149,797.
	
	1876 - Alexander Graham Bell - moving armature microphone. U.S. Patent 174,465. This microphone type is also attributed to Joseph Henry.
