Question:
Is it possible to re-use the UA830A and UA830UB inline antenna amplifiers for new wireless microphone gear operating in the 470-698 MHz core TV broadcast band?What is the usable bandwidth of the UA830A and UA830UB inline antenna amplifiers?


Answer:

	Following is the operating bandwidth information for the UA830A and UA830UB inline antenna amplifiers:
	 
	
		
			
				UA830A
			
				Frequency - Low (MHz)
			
				Frequency - High (MHz)
		
		
			
				Specified Bandwidth
			
				782
			
				806
		
		
			
				Measured 3 dB Bandwidth
			
				781
			
				818
		
		
			
				Measured 10 dB Bandwidth
			
				775
			
				824
		
		
			
				 
			
				 
			
				 
		
		
			
				UA830UB
			
				 
			
				 
		
		
			
				Specified Bandwidth
			
				692
			
				716
		
		
			
				Measured 3 dB Bandwidth
			
				692
			
				722
		
		
			
				Measured 10 dB Bandwidth
			
				685
			
				728
		
	

	The UA830A and UA830UB in-line antenna amplifiers feature bandpass filters with relatively sharp cutoffs.  Consequently, they will need to be replaced with new wideband in-line amplifiers, model UA830USTV, when changing out "700 MHz band" wireless microphone equipment.  The UA830A and UA830UB inline amplifiers will substantially attenuate any signals outside of their filter passbands.
