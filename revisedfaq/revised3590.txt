Question:
I need a PS20 power supply for my Shure wireless receiver. Is there a commercial alternative?


Answer:

	The following power supply will work:
	Triad AC/DC adapter - model WDU12-600
	AC input is 120 VAC / 13 watts.\
	VDC output is 12 volts / 600 mA.
	DC output cable is 72 inches in length.
	DC connector is 2.1 mm x 5.5 mm.
	Size of the transformer / AC plug enclosure is 3" x 2.2" x 1.9".
	This is a linear supply, not a switching power supply.  For most situations, this supply can also replace the Shure PS21.
	
	As of January 2015, available from www.mouser.com
	Phone: 800-346-6873
