Question:
I connect the X2u to a Macintosh computer. The X2u works fine with Garageband. With Digital Performer, software recognizes Shure Digital, but I get the error message \”MOTU MAS error\”. No audio passes through to DAW. With Logic Pro 8, software recognizes Shure Digital but I get no audio either.


Answer:

	Quit the software and swap the USB port to which the X2u is connected. Relaunch after the X2u has re-enumerated. This should solve the issue.
