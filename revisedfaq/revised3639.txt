Question:
My ears are large and the SRH240 ear cup pads are uncomfortable. Are there pads available that have a larger opening?


Answer:

	Yes. The ear cup pads for the SRH440 have larger ear openings and will fit the SRH240. The oval opening in the SRH440 ear cup pad measures 65mm by 45mm at the widest points. The part number for two SRH440 ear cup pads is HPAEC440.
