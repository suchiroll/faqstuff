Question:
What are the basic features and operation of the SE115M?


Answer:

	The SE115M includes a pair of SE115 earphones, a microphone, and a push button switch.  The earphones serve a dual purpose: to listen to music or to listen to the person on the other end of the call.  The microphone is used to speak to the other person during a call.
	
	The switch is actuated to SEND a new phone call or to END an existing phone call.  When actuated, the switch shorts the mic signal line to ground.  Typically, this action is interpreted by the phone as a SEND call or an END call function.
	
	NOTE: It is the phone design that determines what happens with this switch is actuated.  The type of function is not determined by the SE115M switch.
	
	The 3.5mm male plug is configured as follows:
	Tip - audio feed to left earphone;
	Ring 1 - audio feed to right earphone; 
	Ring 2 - ground return for earphones and for microphone;
	Sleeve - audio feed from microphone.
	
	The operating voltage range for the microphone is 1.5Vdc to 3.6Vdc.  The current draw is 0.25 mA maximum.
	
	IMPORTANT: The mic and switch function of the SE115M will not work with most Apple phones.
