Question:
I bought some Shure sound isolating earphones (SE210) awhile back (and they're great). I've recently upgradedmy computer system and I'm faced with a sound dilemma: I'm working with a 13" Mac Book Pro with a single audio port. I'd like to find a way to get high quality sound out to my earphones and external speakers without switching jacks all the time. Both work great in the audio port. I don't have USB speakers, as I've found powered speakers deliver better sound - so I have a free USB port.
Is it possible to run my Shure earphones through the USB port via an adaptor?



Answer:

	Startach makes an inexpensive device: the USB2.0 to Audio Adapter/Converter. Shure earphone customers report that this device works well. It is supplied with a small 6" extension cable that is helpful if the USB ports on the computer are close together. The user can switch audio output devices by option-clicking the Mac menu volume icon.
