Question:
Hello, I have 10 or so SM57 mics and need some information on them. I need to know the thread size at the point where the microphone splits into two sections.


Answer:

	The diameter of the thread  is 1 and 3/32".  The thread type is 32UNS-2B.  FYI - Shure products are blatantly counterfeited in Asia.  So we cautiously guard all engineering specs.
