Question:
Why were the Quietspot headsets discontinued? Is there a replacement for it?


Answer:

	The Quietspot was discontinued because cell phone manufacturers constantly change the electrical characteristics and connection configurations of the microphone/earphone jacks.   Shure decided to exit the cell phone headset market due to this lack of standardization. Shure customers were being inconvenience whenever they changed/updated their cell phone, only to discover that the Quietspot did not work as it had before.
