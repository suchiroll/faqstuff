Question:
On the P9R receiver LCD screen, there is a small symbol in the upper right hand corner. It is a circle with single diagonal line in the center. What does this mean? How can I remove this icon?


Answer:

	This icon indicates that the Pilot Tone (also known as Tone Key) Squelch feature is turned on, but the Noise Squelch feature is turned off. To remove this icon, activate theNoiseSquelch feature on the P9R via the LCD menu: RADIOSQUELCH.
