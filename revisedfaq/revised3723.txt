Question:
I believe the PS21US power supply for my SLX4 receiver is defective or starting to fail. What are the symptoms?


Answer:

	1) Flashing SLX4 LCD panel (almost fully on to fully off) and Audio Frequency noise output that is consistent in repetition with the flashing.
	2) Faint flickering in the LCD panel, dim backlight, and sometimes no Audio output from the receiver.
	3) Flashes of full Audio Frequency LED's, and simultaneous flashing of "Ready" indicator, plus no Audio output from the receiver.
	
	Any of the above can indicate a faulty PS21US power supply.
