Question:
Now that June 12, 2010 has passed, what type of service is using the 716 to 722 MHz band (TV 55) in the United States?



Answer:

	FLO TV, owned by Qualcomm, was designed as a solution for mobile service providers to provide television programming while simultaneously easing network bandwidth concerns. The FLO TV system transmits data across a frequency band that is different from the bands used by mobile networks. 
	
	FLO TV operates in the 716MHz-722MHz frequency band in the United States.  Before June 12, 2010, this frequency band was used for TV channel 55 in the U.S.
