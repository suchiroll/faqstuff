Question:
I would like to know the out put power of the P2R receiver into 32 Ohms. Basically, how many mW does the P2R send to 32 Ohm headphones.


Answer:

	The maximum output power is approximately 17mW with the left output and the right output each loaded with 32 ohms.
	
	Test Conditions:
	- Test signal - 1 kHz sine wave tone
	- P2R output termination - 32 Ohm resistor
	- Test signal into  transmitter set to just below limiting - i.e. just before audio level light illuminates red.
	- Volume control on P2R set at maximum.
	- Limiter light on P2R receiver off - but just on the threshold of active.
	
	Measurement Results:
	P2R output signal, 32 Ohm load on one channel only = 0.80 Vrms - equals about 19 mW.
	P2R output signal, 32 Ohm load on both left and right output channels = 0.75 Vrms - equals about 17 mW.
