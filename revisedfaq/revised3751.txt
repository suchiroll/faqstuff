Question:
I own the PG30 headworn microphone. The supplied foam windscreen falls off easily. Is there a quick and cheap way to fix this?


Answer:

	Yes, and the solution is Velcro.  It is the hook Velcro portion that will be used, not the softer loop Velcro portion. From a local hardware store or craft score, purchase Velcro that has an adhesive on its backing.
	
	Cut from the hook Velcro a piece that is 1/4" (5 mm) wide and 1" (25 mm) long.  Peel off the backing and expose the adhesive.  Adhere the hook Velcro onto the PG30 mic body - either above or below the openings on the side of the mic element.  Do not cover the side opening with the Velcro as this will degrade the microphone's acoustical performance.
	
	The hook Velcro will grab onto the tiny cell openings in the foam windscreen and hold the windscreen quite securely.
