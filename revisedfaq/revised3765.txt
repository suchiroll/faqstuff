Question:
On the rear of the SLX4 receiver is a screwdriver adjustable level control. What is the adjustment range?


Answer:

	The range is 25 dB.  This adjustment is an attenuator ("pad") and reduces the signal level; it does not add gain. This control should be set to maximum unless the signal level from the SLX4 is clipping the input of the next device in the signal.
