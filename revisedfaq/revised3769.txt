Title: Maximum power rating of headphones
Id: 3769
Legacy Id: 4005

Question:
On my Shure headphones, is the power rating 500mW per side at 1Khz (L=500mW, R=500mW) or 1000 mW for each side?And is that a sustained (A.C. rms) level?


Answer:

	The 1000 mW rating is per side.We use broadband noise for this specification, not a 1 kHz tone.

	We do subject the headphones to a prolonged 1000 mW signal as part of the verification process, but the main intent of the specification is to ascertain that the headphones can survive short-term exposure to excessive transient signals.
