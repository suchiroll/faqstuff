Question:
I have a collection of WL93 mics of different vintage. Is there a method to tell the older ones from the newer ones?


Answer:

	To determine the WL93 version, measure the resistance between the red wire and the black wire.  Connect the red wire to the + lead on ohm meter; the black wire to the - lead on ohm meter.
	
	1) Measurement result = Approximately 700 to 800 ohms - older version of WL93.
	
	2) Measurement result = Approximately 18.6k ohms - newer version of WL93.
