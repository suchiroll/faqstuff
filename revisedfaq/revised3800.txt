Question:
What is the heat dissipation of a UR4 wireless microphone receiver? We need to provide adequate cooling to accommodate several receivers in a closed cabinet.


Answer:

	The UR4 receivers utilize AC power for operation.   A high percentage of the power used is converted to heat.  So the heat dissipation of a UR4 receiver can essentially be calculated from the AC power consumed.
	
	There are several variables that can affect the exact power required by a receiver:
	1 - Ambient temperature - power drawn will increase slightly with temperature.
	2 - Active antenna system components, such as line RF amplifiers and amplified antennas can optionally be powered from the antenna   terminals on the receiver.
	3 - Audio level - current required by LED level indicators, the headphone amplifier, and the line driver can cause small variations in the required power.
	
	Here is typical/maximum required AC power and estimated heat dissipation:
	
	UR4S Single Receiver Chassis
	     Typical power required:  18 Watts (~62 BTU/hr)
	     Maximum power required:  21 Watts (~72 BTU/hr)
	
	UR4D Dual Receiver Chassis
	     Typical power required:  24 Watts (~82 BTU/hr)
	     Maximum power required:  27 Watts (~93 BTU/hr)
