Question:
What was the TTR-116? Is it still available?


Answer:

	Created in 1979, the TTR-116 was designed to test output level and channel crosstalk. Both sides of the 33 1/3rpm LP record were the same. It was not a consumer test record.
	
	Sine wave signals were recorded at 1kHz with a 5cm/second peak velocity. The record bands alternated between left and right channel recordings. The record label had a strobe pattern for setting turntable speed.
	
	Sorry, the TTR-116 is no longer available.
