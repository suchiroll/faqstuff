Question:
Please provide a source for a mic stand adapter, with a shock mount, for a handheld wireless transmitter. I need to isolate my handheld wireless mic from vibrations.


Answer:

	The SP-30 stand adapter / shock mount is designed to hold the large diameter handle [30 mm diameter or greater] of a wireless handheld transmitter. The SP-30 is available from: The Olsen Audio Group, U.S. telephone 480-998-7140.
	
	Or there is the shock mount model MY330 from On Stage Stands, available from Guitar Center.
	
	The Shure WA371 wireless mic clip does not have a shock mount.  It's diameter is 30 mm or 1.20"
