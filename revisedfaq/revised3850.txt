Question:
I see that in the software, the AXT400 receiver and AXT610 antenna distro can be set to operate in different frequency bands. How is this executed?


Answer:

	The AXT400 and AXT630 have multiple signal paths for the various frequency ranges.  When a paticular range is selected in the menu, the AXT400/AXT630 switches the incoming RF signal to follow the appropriate path on the circuit board.
