Question:
We only use our Axient wireless on Sundays. If the batteries are in the SBRC or AXT900 charger will they be fully charged after a week or does the battery start to deplete?



Answer:

	As long as the battery is in the charger, the charger will top off the batteries if any depletion occurs. Thus, they will be fully charged when you need them.
