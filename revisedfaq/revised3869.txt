Question:
I have a sousaphone (tuba) and I would like to use it with a wireless mic system. What do you recommend?


Answer:

	Interesting question as the low frequencies of the sousaphone can be difficult for any wireless system.Here are the current Shure products that will best reproduce the sousaphone pitch range:Wireless system:   PGXD14/BETA98H We strongly urge that you audition this equipment before you buy it.   Your ear is the final judge about the performance of the wireless system.
