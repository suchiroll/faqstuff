Question:
When I try to install Wireless Workbench v5.0.4 on a Macintosh running Snow Leopard in 64-bit mode, I get an error message that says "Error: Couldn't raise admin privileges". Is there a solution for this?

Answer:

	It is recommend that you upgrade to Wireless Workbench 6.
	
	If you must use Wireless Workbench 5, you can following these instruction as a work around.
	
	Wireless Workbench 5 software can run on a Macintosh running the Snow Leopard 64-bit kernal, but the installation program must run while the OS is in 32-bit mode.
	
	Restart while holding the 3 and 2 keys simultaneously to boot into the 32-bit kernal.
	
	Run the Wireless Workbench 5 installer.
	
	Restart the computer.
	
	Run the Wireless Workbench 5 application (Workbench.app located in Applications-Shure-Shure Wireless Workbench Software-5.0)
	
	Note: you can verify the mode in which your system is running at any time by:
	
		Choosing "About This Mac" from the Apple menu.
	
		Click the "More Info" button.
	
		In the "Contents" section, select "Software."
	
		If the entry "64-bit Kernal and Extensions" says "Yes," the computer is running the 64-bit kernal. If it says "No," it is running the 32-bit kernal.
