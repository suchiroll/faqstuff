Question:
I am linking four SCM410 auto mixers together. I want to know how to set last mic on function. Do I set the dip switches on all four mixers to on? Or just the last one in the link. I don't want four mics staying on, but I also don't want the last on mic limited to the last on from the last mixer in the link.


Answer:

	The Last Mic Lock On function must be set to ON for all four mixers.   
	
	The four linked mixers will act like one 16 channel mixer, thus only one mic will be locked on...not four.
