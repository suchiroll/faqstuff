Question:
Any suggestions for a microphone to work with an IPOD touch 4th generation or an IPAD?


Answer:

	Shure does not offer a professional mic specific for iphone devices, primarily because the 3.5 mm connector is an unreliable connector, and the mic inputs of these devices are not designed to work with a professional, low impedance, balanced microphone output.

	

	Here is an accessory that could be useful for this requirement:

	NOTE: Shure has not tested this accessory. Shure does not endorse this accessory.
