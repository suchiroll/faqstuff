Question:
I need to connect the unbalanced output of a consumer CD player (RCA female jack) into the balanced input of the Shure SCM800. What is the proper wiring?


Answer:

	1) Set the SCM800 input to LINE.
	2) Obtain a cable with a twisted pair of inner conductors (A and B) and a shield.
	3) Fabricate and connect the cable as follows:
	
	RCA male tip  to inner conductor A  to SCM800 input terminal "positive" (same as XLR male pin 2)
	RCA male sleeve  to inner conductor B to SCM800 input terminal "negative" (same as XLR male pin 3)
	RCA male sleeve  to cable shield to SCM800 input terminal "ground" (same as XLR male pin 1)
	
	Note: If audible hum is encountered, disconnect the cable shield at the SCM800 input terminal "ground" (same as XLR pin 1)
