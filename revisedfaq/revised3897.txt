Question:
What are the PS124 and the PS124L?


Answer:

	Introduced in June 2011, the PS124 In-Line Power Supply is a solution for DC power supply cable management when multiple Shure wireless receivers or PSM transmitters are used. The PS124 consists of the Shure PS45 In-Line Power Supply with a DC power-splitter cable, and allows DC power distribution into four DC power connections via a single in-line power supply.
	
	Two Models:
	PS124 - with non-locking power connectors. For use with multiple PG, PGX, PGXD, BLX, QLXD, SLX receivers and P2T, P3Ttransmitters.
	
	PS124L - with locking power connectors. For use with multiple GLXD4, ULXP4, ULXS4, and ULXD4 receivers and P9T transmitters.
	
	
	The length of the power-splitter cable is one meter (40 inches).
	Each of the four coax DC power output connectors has an O.D. of 2.5 mm and an I.D of 2.1 mm.
	The single threaded DC power input connector that mates with the PS45 has an O.D. of 5.5 mm and and I.D of 2.5 mm.
