Question:
I just purchased the SE215 earphones and my right ear is sore after wearing them for a hour.


Answer:

	Experiment with the different types and sizes of flexible sleeves included with the SE215.   Each ear canal has a different size and shape.
Some ear canals are so tiny that none of the flexible sleeves will work.  In that case, a custom made ear sleeve is the choice.  For that, contact: www.sensaphonics.com
