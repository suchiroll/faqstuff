Question:
We need assistance for coordinating all of our wireless gear (mics, in ear monitors, and intercom). Does Shure offer this service? If not, who does?


Answer:

	Sorry, Shure does not offer frequency coordination services like you require.  There is free software from Shure, Wireless Workbench Bench, for do-it-yourelf frequency coordination. 
	
	And there are companies that offer this service:
