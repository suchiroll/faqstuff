Question:
The best way to mike a tabla is to use a SM57 or a Beta57 for the dayan and a PG56 for the bayan, in a single stand with a double mike adapter. Otherwise you can choose to take two separate stands. These are the two mikes IÂ´m using since 2005, with excellent results, playing in many countries with the best master performers, with a great range of values of temperature, humidity and altitude. Those two mikes also are recommended for studio recording, I already did it with excellent results!.
