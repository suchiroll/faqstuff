Question:
We have WBH54 Headsets for our wireless systems. I have a special event coming up and wondered if there was a way to use them as wired? Is there a cable that would change them to XLR?


Answer:

	This will require the addition of an inline preamp, modelRPM626. The output of the RPM626 is a male XLR connector.

	The mixer must provide phantom power to operate the RPM626 inline preamp.
