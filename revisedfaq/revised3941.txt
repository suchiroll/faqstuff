Question:
Does the AxientInterference Detection and Avoidance also work with the UR1 or UR2 transmitters?


Answer:

	When using the UR1 or UR2 with the AXT400 receiver, Interference Detection will work. However, Avoidance requires AXT transmitters.
	
	That is, the AXT400 receiver will detect the interference, but the UR transmitters will not be able to automatically tune to a new frequency.
