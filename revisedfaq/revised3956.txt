Question:
What is the purpose of the Talk Switch on the Axient system?


Answer:

	The Talk Switch accessory on the Axient system allows the talent to switch the audio to different listeners. For example, a singer might want to tell their monitor engineer about an adjustment, but that should not go over the main PA. Television on-air personalities can push the button to talk to their producer.
	
	There are three Talk Switchmodes:

	
		Push To Use TRS Output: audio routed to 1/4 TRS when button pushed, audio routed to XLR always on.
	
		Push to Use XLR Output: audio routed to XLR when button pushed, audio routed to 1/4 TRS always on.
	
		Push to Toggle XLR and TRS: button not pushed = XLR on, TRS off; button pushed = XLR off, TRS on.
