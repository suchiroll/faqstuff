Title: Location of User Defined Series file Mac OS X

Legacy Id: 4416

Question:
I recently replaced a hard drive in my primary Mac computer and have been unable to locate the file that contains the User Defined Series for Wireless Workbench 5.0.5.2. As there were many non-Shure products entered, I would love to recover the old file(s). Could you please tell me where to find them?



Answer:

	From the Finder, navigate to Applications-Shure-Shure Wireless Workbench Software-5.0-Compatibility. That folder contains a file called FCUserDefined.txt. All User Defined series data is contained in this file.
