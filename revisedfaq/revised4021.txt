Legacy Id: 4428

Question:
What is the status of the WL50, WL51, MC50, and MC51 miniature microphones? If discontinued, what are the replacements?



Answer:

	As of February 2012, all versions of the WL50, WL51, MC50, and MC51 microphones are discontinued.
	
	Replacement models are:
	WL50B = MX150B/O-TQG
	WL51B = MX150B/C-TQG
	MC50B = MX150B/O-XLR
	MC51B = MX150B/C-XLR
	
	There are noreplacements for tan (T)versions or white (W)versions of the WL50 or WL51.
	There is no replacement for the WL50BX unterminated cable version.
	There is no direct replacement for the low sensitivity versions (LO)of the WL50.

	
		MX150/O is -46dBV; WL50 is -45 dBV; WL50-LO is -54 dBV.
		MX150/Cis -51dBV; WL51 is -50 dBV.


	MX150 or MX153 can be used as a wired mic when paired with the preamp RK100PK.
	
	Improvements offered in the MX150 series:
	- Improved headroom with clipping levels of 143 to 147 dB Max SPL
	- CommShield technology to reduce Radio Frequency Interference issues
	- New cable, softer flex, Kevlar reinforced, for reduced handling noise
	- New tie clip that will mount single or dual lavaliers in various configurations, with integrated cable management for easy dress and reduced cable noise
	- New windscreen that securely snaps on
	- MX150 omnidirectional versions have new interchangeable frequency caps for a smoother sound with less boost in the top end
	- New storage pouch
	- Cartridge design modifications for improved consistency between microphones
