Question:
"Nm" flashes on the bottom of the UR4D+ LCDscreen -what does the Nm stand for?


Answer:

	Nm indicates that the bodypack is at Normal RF power level. It is possible to switch the bodypack to a high powered mode, and then the display would change to Hi.
	
	Page 14 of the UR4D user guide has instructions on changing the RF power level.
