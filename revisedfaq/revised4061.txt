Question:
We have approximately 50Model MX412D/S microphones we use for our battle command.We currently receive a lot of P-popping sounds when speakers talk.Normally they sound clear, but occassionally they "pop" a lot when spoken into. Is there a reason why?Any suggestions?As I mentioned...they do sound clear overall when doing mic checks/common use.


Answer:

	The P-popping is called a plosive;it originates from a blast of air that hits the mic element.The S element being used (supercardioid) is very sensitive to plosives.
	

	Idea #1:To reduce the plosive without changing the mic element, add a Shure windscreen model A99WS or A412MWS.
	

	Idea #2:Remove the S mic element (it unscrews) and replace with the model R183B - omnidirectional element.Add the A99WS and the mic will be be 99% free of plosives.There may be an increase in background noise using the R183B, so I recommend trying it on one mic only as an experiment.
