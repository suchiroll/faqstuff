Title: ULXD1 Power Switch and Alkaline Batteries

Question:
Please tell me if this is proper operation of the ULXD1.
1) Power switch is ON.
2) The alkaline AA batteries are removed and replaced with new ones.
3) Power switch must be set to OFF and then to ON for the ULXD1 to operate again.
It seems that replacing the batteries "overrides" the Power switch. Is this correct?





Answer:

	Yes, this is correct operation for the ULX1D. When new alkaline cells (batteries) are inserted, move the power switch from ON to OFF to ON.
	
	If the power switch was already set to OFF during the battery change, simply move it to ON once the new cells are in place.
