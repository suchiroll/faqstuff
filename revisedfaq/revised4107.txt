Question:
I play the bagpipes and would like to know what wireless mic you recommend? I need to mic the chanter and the drones. Thank you for your help.


Answer:

	1) Recommended wireless system:Shure Axient Digital series
	

	2) Recommended mics:MX150 seriesOne placed on the shirt front near the chanter. One worn over the ear for the drones. The following link provides a simple method for transforming the MX150 into an earworn microphone: Earworn Microphone

	
	3) An electronics technician can fabricate a Y-cable that will connect both MX150 mics into one body pack transmitter.
