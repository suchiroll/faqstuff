	Item#2: Contact the Shure agent in each country for assistance: http://www.shure.eu/where-to-buy/index.htm

	

	Item #3: In general, U.S. wireless systems that operate in the band of 470 - 698 MHz can be used in many European countries. Pro audio wireless transmitters must be rated at 50 mW or less. Exceptions for higher power transmitters can be requested in some countries.

	

	Item #4: U.S. wireless products do not always meet the EU regulations for EMC, safety, or general CE markings. Therefore, U.S. wireless products without the proper European approval marks could be stopped at the border by Customs.

	

	Item #5: As tours are limited in time and in location, it is feasible to use some U.S. wireless products in Europe if the proper authorization/license is received from the RF spectrum government agency in each country.
