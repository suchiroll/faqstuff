Question:
Can the UR5 rechargeable battery pack (SB900A) be recharged by placing the UR5 into the SBC200 charger?


Answer:

	Sorry, the answer is no. For recharging, remove the battery pack from the UR5, then place the battery pack into the SBC200.

	(The purpose of the UR5 external battery contacts is for providing DC power from an outside source, such as an Anton Bauer battery pack.)
