Question:
What improvements does the UA874US antenna offer over the UA870USTV antenna?


Answer:

	Introduced in May 2012, the UA874US directional antenna has the following improvements:

	Switchable RF Signal Gain: +12 dB, +6 dB, 0 dB, -6 dB

	RF Overload LED: -5dBm illumination threshold

	
	

	NOTE: The UA874US is a receiving antenna only. It cannot be used as a PSM transmitting antenna.

	

	

	Other characteristics of the UA874US:

	Connector Type: BNC Female
	
	Impedance: 50 Ohms
	
	Power Requirement: 10 to 15 V DC bias from coaxial connection, 75 mA

	NOTE: Bias is always required, even with the 0 dB or- 6dB gain setting.
	

	Reception Pattern: 70 degrees
	
	Third-order Intercept Point: 30 dBm
	
	Antenna Gain (On Axis) : 7.5 dBi
	
	Dimensions: 316 mm x 359 mm x 36 mm (H x W x D)
	
	Weight: 317 g (11.2 oz)

	

	Update: As of July 2012, inventory of of the UA870 antenna has been depleted. If an existing UA870 needs replacement, set the gain on the new UA874US to within 3 dB of the replaced UA870. UA870 gain settings were +3 dB and +10 dB.
