Question:
How do I connect an Audio Technica 898C to the TA4 connector on a Shure bodypack?


Answer:

	Connecting Audio Technica’s 898C microphone to any Shure bodypack transmitter with a Switchcraft TA4M input connector (shown below.)


	To make this modification it is necessary to remove the connector or power module attached to the microphone cable. This will require disassembling the connector or power module and unsoldering the attached cable or simply cutting off the cable at the strain relief. Once this is accomplished, the following color codes configuration can be applied to equip the exposed cable with a Switchcraft TA4F connector for mating with the Shure wireless transmitter.

		Transmitter
	


	
		Red wire (s)
	
	
		---
	
	
		Pin 2
	


	
		White wire (s)
	
	
		---
	
	
		Pin 3 and Pin 4
	


	
		Shield
	
	
		---
	
	
		Pin 1
	




	The mating connector for the Shure wireless transmitters is a Switchcraft TA4F. This connector is available from the Shure Service Department at 800-516-2525 as part number WA330.


	The connector can also be purchased from Mouser Electronics at 800-346-6873.

		PIN 1 = cable shield / audio return / bias return
		PIN 2 = +5V DC Bias
		PIN 3 = audio input for dynamic mics or instruments
		PIN 4 = 20K Ohms resistor to ground jumpered to pin 3 for condenser mics
