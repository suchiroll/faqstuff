Question:
I want to control the ULX-D receiver with a Crestron touchscreen. What are the control strings?



Answer:

	The ULXD6, ULXD8, SBC850, SBC450, ULXD4, ULXD4D, and ULXD4Q can be monitored and controlled via a control system, such as AMX, Crestron, or Extron.
	
	Below is a PDF of the command strings.
	
	The AMX/Crestron can control and/or monitor the following items:
	
		Mute
	
		Volume
	
		Names
	
		Frequency
	
		Battery Usage Information
	
		Interference Detection
	
		Audio & RF Meters
	
		Encryption
