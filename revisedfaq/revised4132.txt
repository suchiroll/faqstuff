Question:
Can you please tell me the required fastener size details for permanently installing the Shure MX392 boundary mic?

Answer:

	There are two key hole slots on the base of the mic. The slots are separated by 23 mm.
	
	The length of the slot is 10 mm; the widest part has a diameter of 6 mm; the narrow part of the slot is 3 mm. Therefore, the head of the fastener must be smaller than 6 mm, but wider than 3 mm.
