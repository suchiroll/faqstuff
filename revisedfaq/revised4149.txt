Question:
Whatis the procedure to lock the GM 5940 gooseneck microphone to the DC 5980P portable conference unit?


Answer:

	There is a set screw located in a hole next to the XLR connector on the DC 5980P. With the GM gooseneck installed, rotate the set screw counter-clockwise until resistance is felt. The set screw requires the use of a 1.5 mm hex wrench.
