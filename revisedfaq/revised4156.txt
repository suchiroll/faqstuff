Id: 4156
Legacy Id: 5062

Question:
What types of adjustments and features are available on the DDS5900 when using a web browser in conjunction with the CU 5905 Control Unit?


Answer:

	Note that a computer and web browser are not required for the operation of the DDS 5900. The features that are accessible via the web browser are considered advanced and are likely notessential for most DDS 5900applications.
	
	A web browser can control the firmware that exists inside of the CU 5905. Six general categories can be accessed:
	
	1) SYSTEM
	2) AUDIO
	3) CONFIGURATION
	4) OPERATION
	5) DIAGNOSTICS
	6) MICROPHONE CONTROL
