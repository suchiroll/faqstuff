Question:
Do you make a mount that will allow me to mount my wireless mic transmitter to my trumpet, rather than attach it to my belt. Would like to keep wire/transmitter directly on trumpet itself.


Answer:

	While not specific for a trumpet, the Shure WA620 pouch has been used by horn players for this use.
