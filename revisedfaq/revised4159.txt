Question:
I have heard the connectors used on Shure earphones called "MMCX." Do these letters meaning anything, besides 2,110 in Roman numerals?



Answer:

	MMCX = Micro Miniature CoaXial connector. The connector on the earphone cable is a male plug with a custom plastic overmold.

	

	This connector was developed by Amphenol. It is available from Digi-Key as part ACX1276-ND.
