Question:
What is the band pass response of the UA830X?


Answer:

	The UA830X band pass, at the 3 dB down point, is approximately 925 - 967 MHz.At the 10 dB down point, itis approximately 920 - 975 MHz.

	

	The UA830X should not be employed outside of its specified operating frequency range. As an example, in the ULX-J1 band of 554 - 590 MHz,(well outside the UA830X operating range), the RF signal is attenuated in excess of 50 dB.
