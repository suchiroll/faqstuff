Question:
I have five MX395B-BI-LED microphones that hum and buzz whenever there is an A.C. power cord placed near the mic. Any ideas?


Answer:

	There is likely an erroneously attached date code label inside of the mic housing tube, positioned exactly where the 5-pin XLR connector ground tab should contact the metal mic housing.This label disrupts the ground path and the result is audible hum/buzz.
	
	To correct the problem in the field: Loosen the XLR set-screw, carefully slide out the circuit board, and scrape the date code label from the inside of the tube.While the circuit board is extracted from the tube, the low frequency roll-off DIP-switches can be adjusted if desired.
	
	As of August 23, 2012, this manufacturing error has been noted and corrected in the MX395 models.
