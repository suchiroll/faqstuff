Question:
I have networked a PC with the latest WWB6 software to several ULX-D Receivers. The PC and receivers are properly networked using a router, the IP addressing and subnet masks are verified, and I can successfully ping the transmitters from the PC. However, WWB6 cannot find the networked transmitters. What is missing?


Answer:

	After checking that the network configuration is correct, it is possible that a mismatch in the firmware version of theULX-D receiverand the required firmware version for interoperability with WWB6 software is preventing communications.
	
	First, it is recommended to verify that the latest version of WWB6 software is loaded in the computer.If a newer version of WWB6 is available, download and install it.
	
	In Shure Update Utility, check for the latest requiredULX-D firmware version.
	
	If the ULX-D receiver firmware version is older than the latest firmware version shown in theUpdate Utilitysoftware, update the receiver firmware.The Update Utility program will connect to the receiver for a firmware update no matter the current version installed, as long as a valid network is configured, and even if WWB6 program reports that it cannot find the receiver. Once the ULX-D receiver firmware is updated to the latest level, WWB6 will find the receivers and report them as online.
