Question:
I just purchased the SRH440 headphone.In the past I've had problems with other headphoneswith the vinyl cracking/peeling.How can I prevent this from occurring to my
new headphones.


Answer:

	Vinyl cracking/peeling often happens because of the salts/oils in human skin.These are absorbed by the vinyl over time.The severity of the cracking/peeling depends upon your personal body chemistry.
	
	Use a clean cloth to wipe off the earpads after each use.On occasion, gently wipe the earpads with warm water and Dawn dishwashing liquid as it cuts grease.
