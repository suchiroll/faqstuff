Question:
Can you use a PSM1000 transmitter with a P9RA beltpack receiver? What about a PSM900 transmitter with a P10R receiver?


Answer:

	It is possible to mix and match the PSM900 and PSM1000 personal monitor system components.A P9RA beltpack receiver can be used with a P9T transmitter or a P10T transmitter.Similarly, a P10R beltpack receiver can be used with either a P10T or a P9T transmitter.
	

	When planning to use a mixture of personal monitor components, be sure to match up the frequency ranges.The PSM900 U.S. frequency ranges are:
	G6--TV channels 14-19, 470-506 MHz
	G7--TV channels 20-25, 506-542 MHz
	K1--TV channels 35-40, 596-632 MHz (discontinued)
	L6--TV channels 45-50, 656-692 MHz(discontinued)
	

	The PSM1000 U.S. frequency ranges are:
	G10 --TV channels 14-25, 470-542 MHz
	J8 --TV channels 28-39, 554-626 MHz (discontinued)
	L8 --TV channels 40-51, 626-698 MHz (discontinued)
	

	So here are the compatible combinations of U.S. frequency bands:
	PSM900-G6PSM1000-G10
	PSM900-G7PSM1000-G10
	PSM900-K1PSM1000-J8 plus 6 MHz overlap to PSM1000-L8
	PSM900-L6PSM1000-L8
