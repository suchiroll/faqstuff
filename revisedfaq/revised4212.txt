Question:
Which clip-on instrument microphone would recommend to work on a concert flute?


Answer:

	We do not recommend a clip-on mic.There is too much mechanical noise transferred to the clipped-on mic from the flute pads opening and closing. Instead, we recommend that the flautist wear a headworn mic that locates the mic element near the flute mouthpiece, such as the Shure Beta 54 or WBH54.
