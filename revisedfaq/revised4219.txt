Question:
Please explain the different pick up patterns (polar patterns) of the KSM9 models.


Answer:

	KMS9: cardioid pattern or supercardioid pattern. Selected by a toggle switch hidden under the mic grille.
	
	KMS9H/S: hypercardioid pattern or subcardioid pattern. Selected by a toggle switch hidden under the mic grille.

	Subcardioid: - 3dB at 90 degrees off-axis; -10 dB at 180 degrees off axis. Sometimesincorrectly referred to as aforward-facing omnidirectional.
	Cardioid: -6dB at 90 degrees off-axis;  -25 dB at 180 degrees off axis.
	Supercardioid: -9 dB at 90 degrees off-axis;  -25 dB at 120 degrees off axis.
	Hypercardioid: -12 dB at 90 degrees off-axis;  -25 dB at 110 degrees off axis.

	* All specifications above based on an acousticinput signal of 1,000 Hz.

	To summarize:
	
	Off-axis rejection at 90 degrees:
	Subcardioid: -3 dB
	Cardioid: -6 dB
	Supercardioid: -9 dB
	Hypercardioid: -12 dB
	
	Angle of maximum rejection:
	Subcardioid: 180 degrees
	Cardioid: 180 degrees
	Supercardioid: 120 degrees
	Hypercardioid: 110 degrees
