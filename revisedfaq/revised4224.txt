Question:
I want to control the Microflex Wireless system with a Crestron touchscreen. What are the API control strings?


Answer:

	The MXW wireless system can be controlled by AMX, Crestron, Extron, etc.
	
	The touch screen can control/monitor:
	
		Volume
	
		Mute
	
		Mic Button Status
	
		Channel Name
	
		Audio Meter
	
		Battery Charge Status
	
		Battery Run Time
	
		and more

	The control string document can be found in the PDF below.
	
	A Crestron module written by Shure can also be found below.
