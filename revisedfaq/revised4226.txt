Question:
What are typical dBA readings for speech?



Answer:

	Maximum shout = 90 dBA at one meter (roughly 40 inches)

	

	Shout = 84 dBA at one meter

	

	Very Loud =78 dBA at one meter

	

	Loud = 72 dBA at one meter

	

	Raised =66 dBA at one meter

	

	Normal = 60 dBA at one meter

	

	Relaxed =54 dBA at one meter

	

	Other dBA readings can be estimated as follows: if the distance is divided by 2, the level increases by 6 dB.

	Example: Maximum Shout at 0.5 meter = 96 dB SPL.
