Title: MX393 Mic Element Active & LED lit
Id: 4245
Legacy Id: 5293

Question:
How can I modify the MX393 so that the mic element is always active and the LED is always illuminated? The external membrane switch marked "PUSH" will do nothing.


Answer:

	MX393 mic element always active = Set internal DIP switch #3 to ON
	
	MX393 LED always illuminated = inside of the MX393, insert a jumper wire between the LED IN screw terminal and the GND screw terminal.
