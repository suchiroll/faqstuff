Question:
The P10T transmitter has two antenna outputs. Why were these not combined into one antenna output?



Answer:

	A passive 2:1 combiner inside the P10T would reduce the RF output power by 3dB. An active combiner would have raised the price substantially and added excessive heat inside the chassis.
